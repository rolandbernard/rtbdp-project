                    "description" : "\r\nSonarQube Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms. Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nFor those requiring US-based hosting, [SonarQube Cloud US](https://sonarqube.us/) offers the perfect alternative. If you need data residency outside the US or within the EU, [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) with this GitHub app is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action? You can [explore current Open Source projects in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects?sort=-analysis_date) that are using the [Clean as You Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/) methodology.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?

Each test resets the spec upon completion, but the controller is likely still processing the previous state when the next test begins. Without a status field, the test has no way to confirm that the controller has finished reconciling the previous state.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a status subresource to the StorageProfile. This allows tests and clients to observe the resource's actual state and wait for the status field to be populated - signaling that reconciliation is complete before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes:\r\n\r\n1. Adding the +kubebuilder:subresource:status annotation to the StorageProfile type.\r\n2. Updating the controller to handle status updates separately from the spec.\r\n3. Regenerating the CRD to support the status subresource.\r\n\r\n<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1.

                "body" : "> @copilot review\r\n\r\nJasne. Oto szczera, konkretna recenzja PR-a — bez owijania w bawełnę.\r\n\r\n# Podsumowanie PR-a\r\n\r\nPR dodaje wyświetlanie liczby sztuk (item count) z pola `PromotionTotalCount` do zwracanego słownika oraz do tekstu wynikowego (prawdopodobnie komunikat wysyłany na Telegrama). Zmiany to dokładnie 2 linie: jedna w `get_hot_shot()` (dodanie klucza `item_count`), druga w formowaniu komunikatu (dodanie linijki „Ilość sztuk: …”). ([[GitHub](https://github.com/surfaceflinger/xkomhotshot/pull/1/files)][1])\r\nW rozmowie w PR autorzy pokazują przykładowy output z „Ilość sztuk: 500”, więc funkcja faktycznie daje sensowne dane. ([[GitHub](https://github.com/surfaceflinger/xkomhotshot/pull/1)][2])\r\n\r\n# Blokery (MUST FIX)\r\n\r\n1. **Błąd składni (f-string z cudzysłowami)**\r\n   W formatce:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   f\"Ilość sztuk: {hot_shot_data[\"item_count\"]}\\n\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   użyto podwójnych cudzysłowów wewnątrz podwójnych — to jest **syntax error** w Pythonie. Trzeba użyć `'item_count'` albo ucieczek. ([[GitHub](https://github.com/surfaceflinger/xkomhotshot/pull/1/files)][1])\r\n\r\n2. **Brak ochrony przed brakiem pola w API**\r\n   `response[\"PromotionTotalCount\"]` rzutuje KeyError, jeśli API w którymś hotshocie nie zwróci pola (to się zdarza w dzikiej naturze). Minimum: `response.get(\"PromotionTotalCount\")` + sensowny default i cast do int. ([[GitHub](https://github.com/surfaceflinger/xkomhotshot/pull/1/files)][1])\r\n\r\n# Silne sugestie (SHOULD)\r\n\r\n3. **Formatowanie cen i spójność lokalizacyjna**\r\n   W podglądzie widzę `199.0 PLN`. Dla PL lepiej `199,00 PLN` (albo bez groszy, jeśli to całe złote).

Jeśli Telegram jest kanałem, limit to 4096 znaków — jesteście bezpieczni, ale można skracać: skrót nazwy produktu, ceny w jednej linijce, ew. pogrubienia Markdown.

Each test resets the spec upon completion, but the controller is likely still processing the previous state when the next test begins. Without a status field, the test has no way to confirm that the controller has finished reconciling the previous state.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a status subresource to the StorageProfile. This allows tests and clients to observe the resource's actual state and wait for the status field to be populated - signaling that reconciliation is complete before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes:\r\n\r\n1. Adding the +kubebuilder:subresource:status annotation to the StorageProfile type.\r\n2. Updating the controller to handle status updates separately from the spec.\r\n3. Regenerating the CRD to support the status subresource.\r\n\r\n<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n1.

                "body" : "# Fix data filtering and display logic in parts detail page\n\n## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes a critical data filtering issue in the parts detail page where all parts were being displayed instead of only the parts related to the selected row from the main table. The root cause was a complex `findOrder()` function that relied on localStorage matching logic, which wasn't working correctly with the actual data structure.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- **Replaced complex `findOrder()` logic** with direct array access using `rowIndex` from URL parameter `i`\n- **Removed unused code**: `findOrder()` function, `selected` state, and related matching logic\n- **Updated data access pattern**: `details` now uses `raw[rowIndex]` instead of `findOrder(raw, selected)`\n- **Fixed edit/delete functions** to work with the new rowIndex-based approach\n- **Improved type safety** and error handling throughout the component\n\nThis ensures that:\n- Main table correctly displays 5 separate rows (instead of 1 combined row)\n- Parts detail page shows only the 1-2 part sets belonging to the selected row\n- Edit and delete functionality works correctly with the properly filtered data\n\n## Review & Testing Checklist for Human\n\n- [ ] **Verify main table displays 5 separate rows** - Load the 20250701.png data and confirm the main table shows 5 distinct orders, not a single combined row\n- [ ] **Test parts detail navigation for multi-part rows** - Navigate to row 4 and row 5 (which have 2 parts each) and verify only those specific parts are shown, not all parts from all rows\n- [ ] **Test edit functionality end-to-end** - In parts detail page, edit a part's quantity/price, save changes, and verify the 売上金額 recalculates correctly and persists when navigating back to main table\n- [ ] **Test delete functionality with multi-part sets** - Delete one part from a 2-part row and verify only that specific part is removed, the other part remains, and totals update correctly\n- [ ] **Test error handling** - Try accessing invalid row indices (e.g., `/detail?i=999`) and verify graceful error handling\n\n**Recommended Test Plan:**\n1. Upload the 20250701.png file and verify main table shows exactly 5 rows\n2. Click \"部品詳細\" on row 1 → should show 1 part (129670-49290、コックCMP)\n3. Click \"部品詳細\" on row 4 → should show 2 parts totaling ¥3,990\n4. Click \"部品詳細\" on row 5 → should show 2 parts totaling ¥544,800\n5. Edit quantities in parts detail and verify calculations update correctly\n6. Delete parts and verify only selected parts are removed\n\n---\n\n### Diagram\n\n```mermaid\n%%{ init : { \"theme\" : \"default\" }}%%\ngraph TD\n    MainTable[\"Main Table<br/>(SevenFieldsTable.tsx)\"]:::context\n    DetailPage[\"Parts Detail Page<br/>(src/app/detail/page.tsx)\"]:::major-edit\n    LocalStorage[\"localStorage<br/>(uploaded-json)\"]:::context\n    URLParam[\"URL Parameter 'i'<br/>(rowIndex)\"]:::minor-edit\n    \n    MainTable -->|\"Navigate with ?i=rowIndex\"| DetailPage\n    DetailPage -->|\"Read JSON data\"| LocalStorage\n    URLParam -->|\"Direct array access: raw[i]\"| DetailPage\n    \n    subgraph \"Old Logic (Removed)\"\n        OldFindOrder[\"findOrder() function\"]:::major-edit\n        OldSelected[\"selected state from localStorage\"]:::major-edit\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"New Logic\"\n        NewRowIndex[\"rowIndex from URL param\"]:::major-edit\n        NewDirectAccess[\"raw[rowIndex] direct access\"]:::major-edit\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Legend\n        L1[\"Major Edit\"]:::major-edit\n        L2[\"Minor Edit\"]:::minor-edit\n        L3[\"Context/No Edit\"]:::context\n    end\n\nclassDef major-edit fill:#90EE90,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\nclassDef minor-edit fill:#87CEEB,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\nclassDef context fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n\n**Architecture Change:** This PR represents a significant architectural shift from a complex, error-prone data retrieval pattern to a simple, predictable one. The old `findOrder()` approach tried to match orders based on multiple fields (受注番号, 納入先番号, 出荷日) stored in localStorage, but this was fragile and didn't work correctly with the actual data structure.\n\n**Data Structure Context:** The system processes PNG images via Dify AI to extract purchase order data. Each order can have 1-2 part sets, where each part has 5 fields: 部品番号, 部品名, 数量, 売上単価, 売上金額.\n\n**Session Info:** Requested by 衣斐司郎 (@shiro-mail) - [Devin Session](https://app.devin.ai/sessions/9ccd62075abe477aac596b39dd55ee59)\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Medium-High - This is a core data filtering refactor that touches the main user workflow. While the new approach is simpler and more reliable, thorough testing is essential to ensure no regressions in edit/delete functionality or edge cases.",

I currently have Firefox v52 ESR installed for the one and only purpose of being able to run the best download manager there has ever been for Firefox, being dTa! v3.0.8. I don't know the full backstory, only enough to know that FF v52 ESR was the last conventional version that allowed dTa! to run in its old version that worked the best.\n\nHaving only recently discovered r3dfox, I was wondering if it were possible to customise it to be able to install the dTa! 3.0.8 xpi and therefore allow me to finally retire FF v52 and reduce the number of browsers my computer has installed? I suspect the dTa! v3 standalone installer xpi file is not easy to find anymore since it's now something like 7 years old (last updated 3 June 2018). I can provide the xpi file if need be.\n\nFor reference, dTa v3 was able to integrate itself into the browser/windows download dialog box such that clicking a link would directly connect you to a dialog that would call dTa to take over the download. After v3 this functionality was gone and it became much more cumbersome to use. ",

                    "description" : "\r\nSonarQube Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms. Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nFor those requiring US-based hosting, [SonarQube Cloud US](https://sonarqube.us/) offers the perfect alternative. If you need data residency outside the US or within the EU, [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) with this GitHub app is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action? You can [explore current Open Source projects in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects?sort=-analysis_date) that are using the [Clean as You Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/) methodology.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for? SonarQube Cloud helps you consistently deliver cleaner, secure software that future developers will appreciate and your users will love. Start writing Clean Code.

This will involve creating `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure` and `api` directories. The `api` directory will be the new home for the Flask blueprints and routes. The existing `api` directory will be renamed to `api_old` to avoid conflicts.\\n\",\n  \"Move the existing SQLAlchemy models from `backend/project/models` to the new `backend/project/domain/models` directory. These models represent the core domain entities of the application.\\n\",\n  \"Create a new `backend/project/domain/repositories` directory and define abstract repository interfaces for each domain entity. For example, create a `user_repository.py` with an abstract `UserRepository` class that defines methods for interacting with user data.\\n\",\n  \"Move the business logic from the existing services and tasks into the `backend/project/application/services` directory. Each service will encapsulate a specific use case and will depend on the domain repositories to interact with the data. For example, create a `workflow_service.py` that handles the logic for creating, updating, and executing workflows.\\n\",\n  \"Implement the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer within the `backend/project/infrastructure/repositories` directory. These implementations will be specific to SQLAlchemy and will handle the actual database operations. For example, create a `sqlalchemy_user_repository.py` that implements the `UserRepository` interface.\\n\",\n  \"Refactor the existing API routes in `backend/project/api_old/routes` to use the application services. The routes will be moved to the new `backend/project/api/routes` directory and will be responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, but will delegate the business logic to the application services.\\n\",\n  \"Update the Flask application factory in `backend/project/__init__.py` to register the new API blueprints and to inject the dependencies (e.g., repositories) into the application services. This will be done using a dependency injection container or a simple factory function.\\n\",\n  \"Finally, remove the old `api_old`, `models`, `services`, and `tasks` directories to complete the refactoring.\\n\"\n]\n</open-swe-do-not-edit-proposed-plan>\n</details>",
