This feature will allow mock functions to receive the request body as input, for both TypeScript and YAML mocks.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Mock functions can optionally receive the request body:\n```ts\n/** @mock (body) => body.username */\nusername: string;\n```\n- When the body is not provided, the function should still produce a valid mock value.\n- The implementation must remain safe for local dev use (no external side effects beyond the body).\n- Compatible with existing simplified mock value generation.",

Please describe.**\nIn Poland there's a company called NetWorks! which was created by both T-Mobile and Orange mainly to build towers and maintain Radio Access Network. The consequence of that is that when you are a client of one of them you often connect to the antennas of the other as seen in app. They have some own towers but from my understanding it's generally rare. And since by default Network Survey filters by currently used operator on map you can't see the tower you are connected to.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI think the easiest solution would be to not filter the MNC or use 2 values. The operators have MNC value of 2 and 3.",

In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nこのプルリクエストは、`BookmarkManager`コンポーネントのテストコードをリファクタリングし、要素が存在しないことのアサーションを改善することを目的としています。`queryAllByRole(...).toHaveLength(0)`を使用していた箇所を、より直感的で簡潔な`queryByRole(...).not.toBeInTheDocument()`に置き換えることで、テストの可読性を高め、同時に不要な`waitFor`ラッパーを削除し、コードを簡素化しています。これにより、テストの意図がより明確になり、保守性が向上します。\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **テストアサーションのリファクタリング**: BookmarkManagerコンポーネントのテストにおいて、要素が存在しないことを確認するアサーションが改善されました。\n* **アサーション方法の変更**: 要素の非存在チェックが、`queryAllByRole(...).toHaveLength(0)`から、より意図が明確な`queryByRole(...).not.toBeInTheDocument()`に変更されました。\n* **テストコードの簡素化**: 新しいアサーション方法の導入により、テストコードから不要な`waitFor`ラッパーが削除され、コードがより簡潔になりました。\n* **可読性と保守性の向上**: これらの変更により、テストの可読性が向上し、テストの意図がコードから直接的に読み取れるようになりました。\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

For example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype LTE struct {\r\n\tStruct struct {\r\n\t\t// +govalid:lte=50\r\n\t\tValue int\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOld: `ErrLTEValueLTEValidation`\r\nNew: `ErrLTEStructValueLTEValidation`\r\n\r\nThis change is necessary to prevent duplicate error variables when field path information is not included in the error variable names.\r\n\r\n`internal/validator/fieldpath.go`:\r\nI needed to handle field paths with and without dots, so I've made the field paths more versatile by creating a FieldPath structure. If you see any potential improvements to this approach, please review.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n#86",

For example:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype LTE struct {\r\n\tStruct struct {\r\n\t\t// +govalid:lte=50\r\n\t\tValue int\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOld: `ErrLTEValueLTEValidation`\r\nNew: `ErrLTEStructValueLTEValidation`\r\n\r\nThis change is necessary to prevent duplicate error variables when field path information is not included in the error variable names.\r\n\r\n`internal/validator/fieldpath.go`:\r\nI needed to handle field paths with and without dots, so I've made the field paths more versatile by creating a FieldPath structure. If you see any potential improvements to this approach, please review.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n#86",

This documentation example is missing a `use embedded_io::Write;` statement and will fail to compile as written. The previous version, `embedded_io::Write::write_all(...)`, worked because it used Universal Function Call Syntax (UFCS), which doesn't require the trait to be in scope.\n\nTo fix this, please add `use embedded_io::Write;` to the example's imports.",

This prevents potential name collisions and import issues in the code that uses the macro.\n\nThe current implementation adds `use` statements inside the macro. While this is an improvement over relying on the calling scope, it can still lead to conflicts if the user has items with the same names (`IoWrite`, `NbWrite`, `block`). Using fully qualified paths is the most robust solution for `macro_rules!` macros.\n\n```rust\n    ($name:ident, nb_write = $write_fn:ident $(, flush = $flush_fn:ident)?) => {\n        /// Serial adapter wrapper\n        pub struct $name<T>(pub T);\n\n        /// Implement embedded-io Write for the wrapper\n        impl<T> ::embedded_io::Write for $name<T>\n        where\n            T: ::nb::serial::Write<u8>,\n        {\n            type Error = <T as ::nb::serial::Write<u8>>::Error;\n            fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, Self::Error> {\n                for &b in buf {\n                    ::nb::block!(self.0.$write_fn(b))?;\n                }\n                Ok(buf.len())\n            }\n            fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {\n                $(::nb::block!(self.0.$flush_fn())?;)?\n                Ok(())\n            }\n        }\n\n        /// Implement core::fmt::Write for writeln! / write!\n        impl<T> ::core::fmt::Write for $name<T>\n        where\n            T: ::nb::serial::Write<u8>,\n        {\n            fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> ::core::fmt::Result {\n                <Self as ::embedded_io::Write>::write_all(self, s.as_bytes())\n                    .map_err(|_| ::core::fmt::Error)\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```",

Available in a number of programming languages and frameworks, these resources are fetched from Secure Code Warrior’s Learning Platform based on the vulnerability descriptions found in issues and pull requests. Only the most relevant learning resources are identified and added as comments - making learning a part of the developers' conversations in GitHub.\r\n\r\n![Secure Code Warrior for GitHub screenshot](https://media.securecodewarrior.com/labs/github_integration_1.png)\r\n\r\n## Get the help you need at the right time\r\nWhen a vulnerability issue is assigned to a developer, they are given help - in the form of learning content in comments - to resolve the issue. We call this contextual micro-learning - bite-sized and highly relevant to the vulnerability in question. Developers can take immediate action to resolve the issue rather than search for resources online that may not be validated or secure. \r\n\r\n## Uses CWE or OWASP references to identify content\r\nThis app will serve training content based on Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) references identified in the issue or pull request title, body, labels or comments. This has been designed to work with several popular security tools that can be configured to push findings into GitHub issues with these references automatically. The app will also search pull request status check output for these references and is compatible with GitHub CodeQL Code Scanning. If no references are included, this app will fall back to searching for common vulnerability names and phrases.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nFor more information on configuring the app, please refer to the [configuration guide](https://help.securecodewarrior.com/hc/en-us/articles/900001737346-Secure-Code-Warrior-for-Github-Issues-Configuration-Guide).\r\n",

The changes are well-structured and improve the usability of the macro.\n\nI have two main suggestions:\n1.  The macro implementation can be made more robust by using fully qualified paths for traits and types, which avoids potential name collisions for users of the macro.\n2.  One of the documentation examples for the macro is missing a necessary `use` statement and will not compile as-is.\n\nThese changes will improve the robustness and correctness of the provided code.",

([github.com](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/releases/tag/v1.2.2))  \n- Host-key verification support: yes — the action exposes a fingerprint input (expects the SHA256 fingerprint of the host public key) you can pass via the fingerprint input. ([github.com](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/tree/v1.2.2))\n\nIf you want, I can paste the minimal example from the README showing how to pass the fingerprint.\n\nCitations:\n\n- 1: https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/releases/tag/v1.2.2\n- 2: https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/tree/v1.2.2\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n**Update appleboy/ssh-action to v1.2.2 and enforce host-key verification**\n\n- File: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (around line 37)  \n- Change the action version from `v0.1.10` → `v1.2.2` (latest stable as of Mar 9 2025).  \n- Add the `fingerprint` input to verify the SSH host key.\n\n```diff\n- uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.10\n+ uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.2.2\n  with:\n    host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}\n    username: deploy\n    key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n+   fingerprint: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST_FINGERPRINT }}\n```\n\n• Ensure `SSH_HOST_FINGERPRINT` is set to your server’s SHA256 host-key fingerprint.  \n• References:  \n  1. Latest release v1.2.2 – https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/releases/tag/v1.2.2  \n  2. `fingerprint` input supported – https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action/tree/v1.2.2\n\n<details>\n<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>\n\n```\n.github/workflows/deploy.yml around line 37: the workflow uses\nappleboy/ssh-action v0.1.10 without host-key verification; update the action\nreference to v1.2.2 and add the fingerprint input using the repository\nsecret/env var SSH_HOST_FINGERPRINT (e.g., fingerprint: ${{\nsecrets.SSH_HOST_FINGERPRINT }}), ensuring the workflow step uses the new\nversion and passes that fingerprint so the SSH host key is verified during\ndeploy.\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:triton:chinchilla -->\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->",

The workflow currently installs only pre-commit/pytest and two optional subproject requirements. Ensure your main/runtime and dev/test dependencies are installed so unit tests can run and properly gate deploys.\n\n\n- Verify pika (and any other test/runtime deps) are listed in requirements.txt or requirements-dev.txt.\n- If logging_config SyntaxError persists, the test job will block deploy, which is likely desired. If you need to proceed despite test failures (not recommended), see my note on conditional continue below.\n\nSuggested augmentation:\n\n```diff\n       - name: Install dependencies\n         run: |\n           python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n           pip install pre-commit pytest\n+          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n+          if [ -f requirements-dev.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements-dev.txt; fi\n           if [ -f src/fastapi_app/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r src/fastapi_app/requirements.txt; fi\n           if [ -f agentic-rag-knowledge-graph/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r agentic-rag-knowledge-graph/requirements.txt; fi\n```\n\nOptionally, if you publish a package with extras, consider `pip install -e '.[dev,test]'` instead of managing multiple files.\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\n\necho \"=== Requirements files found ===\"\nfind . -type f -name \"requirements*.txt\" || echo \"No requirements*.txt files found\"\n\necho\necho \"=== Checking for 'pika' in requirements files ===\"\nfor file in $(find . -type f -name \"requirements*.txt\"); do\n  echo \"File: $file\"\n  grep -n \"pika\" \"$file\" || echo \"  → no 'pika' entry\"\ndone\n\necho\necho \"=== Checking for root requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt ===\"\nfor f in requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt; do\n  if [ -f \"$f\" ]; then\n    echo \"Contents of $f:\"\n    sed -n '1,20p' \"$f\"\n  else\n    echo \"  $f not found\"\n  fi\ndone\n\necho\necho \"=== Locating logging_config files ===\"\nfind . -type f -name \"logging_config*.py\" || echo \"No logging_config*.py found\"\n\necho\necho \"=== Showing first 50 lines of logging_config.py (if any) ===\"\nif file=$(find . -type f -name \"logging_config*.py\" | head -n1); then\n  echo \"File: $file\"\n  head -n50 \"$file\"\nelse\n  echo \"  Skipping, no logging_config file present\"\nfi\n```\n\nLength of output: 3406\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\n\necho \"=== Attempting to compile logging_config.py ===\"\npython3 -m py_compile src/logging_config.py && echo \"Compilation successful\" || echo \"Compilation failed\"\n```\n\nLength of output: 384\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n**Ensure core/dev dependencies are installed & fix logging_config syntax**\n\nThe workflow currently only installs `pre-commit`/`pytest` and two sub-project reqs. We found no root-level `requirements.txt` or `requirements-dev.txt`, and `pika` (plus any other runtime/test deps) isn’t listed anywhere—so tests will fail. Additionally, `src/logging_config.py` contains a syntax error (`_LOGGING_CONFIGURED = False` inside a dict literal), which must be corrected for the module to compile.\n\nPlease address both issues:\n\n• Add and populate root files listing your main and dev/test dependencies (e.g. `requirements.txt` & `requirements-dev.txt`, including `pika`).  \n• Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to install them:\n\n```diff\n       - name: Install dependencies\n         run: |\n           python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n           pip install pre-commit pytest\n+          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n+          if [ -f requirements-dev.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements-dev.txt; fi\n           if [ -f src/fastapi_app/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r src/fastapi_app/requirements.txt; fi\n           if [ -f agentic-rag-knowledge-graph/requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r agentic-rag-knowledge-graph/requirements.txt; fi\n```\n\n• Correct `src/logging_config.py` so `_LOGGING_CONFIGURED = False` is defined outside any dict literal and the surrounding braces/brackets are balanced.\n\nOptionally, if you’ve defined extras in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, you can replace multi-file installs with:\n\n```bash\npip install -e '.[dev,test]'\n```\n\nThis ensures pytest can import all required packages and prevents deploys from being blocked by missing deps or syntax errors.\n\n<details>\n<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>\n\n```\nIn .github/workflows/deploy.yml around lines 17 to 23 the workflow only installs\npre-commit/pytest and two subproject requirement files, which misses root-level\nruntime/dev deps and so tests will fail; add installation of root requirements\n(requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt) or use pip install -e '.[dev,test]'\nin that step (ensure it runs before tests), and include pika in the root\nrequirements; additionally fix src/logging_config.py by moving the line\n`_LOGGING_CONFIGURED = False` out of any dict literal and correcting any\nunbalanced braces/brackets so the module compiles cleanly.\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:triton:chinchilla -->\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->",

Please update the workflow to include one of the following before any SSH invocation:\n\n• Add a setup step to populate `known_hosts`:  \n  ```yaml\n  - name: Add SSH host to known_hosts\n    run: ssh-keyscan -H \"$DEPLOY_HOST\" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n  ```\n\n• Enforce StrictHostKeyChecking on your SSH commands:\n  ```yaml\n  - name: Deploy via SSH\n    run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes \"$DEPLOY_USER@$DEPLOY_HOST\" \"bash deploy.sh\"\n    env:\n      DEPLOY_USER: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}\n      DEPLOY_HOST: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}\n      DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n  ```\n\n• If you’re using an action like `appleboy/ssh-action`, configure its `host_key` (or `proxy`) inputs as documented to embed the server’s public key.\n\nImplementing one of these options will ensure SSH host key verification is enforced.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>.github/workflows/deploy.yml (4)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`4-6`: **Confirm branch filters and consider running checks on PRs as well**\n\nCurrently the workflow only runs on push to work and manual dispatch.

If that’s the intended safety gate, great. If you want to allow manual workflow_dispatch to proceed with deploy even when tests fail, you can either:\n- mark the test step as continue-on-error conditionally, or\n- guard the deploy job with if: and allow it on workflow_dispatch irrespective of test result.\n\nLet me know your preference and I can generate a precise diff.\n\n---\n\n`1-67`: **Overall: solid structure and sequencing**\n\nGood separation into test, deploy, and post-deploy jobs with proper dependency ordering.

However, there’s no rollback if the post-deploy health check (`curl -f`) fails. To improve resilience, consider adding an automated rollback pattern in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:\n\n• Persist previous image digests/tags before deploying (e.g.,  \n  ```bash\n  docker-compose images --format json > last_good_images.json\n  ```  \n  stored as an artifact or on the server)  \n• On a failed health check, add a rollback step that:  \n  – pulls & re-tags the digests from `last_good_images.json`  \n  – or re-runs `docker-compose up -d` with the last-known-good image tags  \n• Alternatively, adopt a blue/green deployment: run two Compose projects and switch traffic via Traefik\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>README.md (3)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`110-113`: **Avoid hardcoding the domain in CI/CD docs; mention the configured domain and add curl resiliency flags.**\n\nThis keeps the README environment-agnostic and aligns with the workflow’s parameterization.\n\n\n```diff\n-## CI/CD via GitHub Actions\n-\n-Automated deployments are provided by the `deploy.yml` workflow.

If that’s the intended safety gate, great. If you want to allow manual workflow_dispatch to proceed with deploy even when tests fail, you can either:\n- mark the test step as continue-on-error conditionally, or\n- guard the deploy job with if: and allow it on workflow_dispatch irrespective of test result.\n\nLet me know your preference and I can generate a precise diff.\n\n---\n\n`1-67`: **Overall: solid structure and sequencing**\n\nGood separation into test, deploy, and post-deploy jobs with proper dependency ordering.

                "body" : "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @dougis, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request introduces robust transaction management capabilities to ensure data consistency and reliability for critical user-related operations. It implements a new `DatabaseTransaction` utility class that provides atomic operations with graceful fallback for MongoDB deployments that do not support transactions, such as standalone instances. This enhancement significantly improves the integrity of multi-write operations like user creation, password resets, and email verifications, preventing partial updates and ensuring data integrity across the application.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Atomic Operations with `DatabaseTransaction`**: A new utility class `DatabaseTransaction` has been introduced to encapsulate MongoDB transaction logic, ensuring that multiple database writes either all succeed or all fail, preventing partial data states.\n* **Automatic Transaction Support & Fallback**: The system now automatically detects if the MongoDB deployment supports transactions (e.g., replica sets) and utilizes them. If transactions are not supported, it gracefully falls back to non-transactional operations, maintaining compatibility.\n* **Enhanced User Service Operations**: Key `UserService` operations, including user creation, password reset token generation, password updates, email verification, and general user profile updates, have been refactored to leverage these new transaction capabilities for improved data integrity.\n* **Session-Aware User Model**: The `User` Mongoose model's instance methods (`generatePasswordResetToken`, `generateEmailVerificationToken`, `updateLastLogin`) have been updated to optionally accept a session parameter, allowing them to participate in ongoing transactions.\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New unit tests for the `DatabaseTransaction` utility and integration tests for `UserService` operations confirm the correct behavior of transactional and fallback mechanisms across various scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

No calendar card can do this yet. Many people use fully kiosk and can't go to the side bar and create an event via the standard calendar.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAn add event button at the bottom of the calendar card pro to add events to your calendar via your own dashboard\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Example use case\n\nThe same principle as the standard calendar of home assistant but via the UI\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
