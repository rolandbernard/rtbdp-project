The current implementation relies on `undefined` being treated as `false` in a conditional, which is correct but less explicit.\n\nBy providing a default value, `allowValidatorFailure` in `ResolvedOptions<T>` will always be a `boolean`, which simplifies reasoning about the code. The type definition for `ResolvedOptions<T>` can also be simplified to reflect this.\n\n```suggestion\ntype ResolvedOptions<T> =\n  & Required<Omit<Options<T>, \"validator\">>\n  & Pick<Options<T>, \"validator\">;\n\nfunction resolveOptions<T>(\n  options: Options<T>,\n): ResolvedOptions<T> {\n  return {\n    validator: options.validator,\n    allowNoExist: options.allowNoExist ?? true,\n    allowValidatorFailure: options.allowValidatorFailure ?? false,\n  };\n}\n```",

The implementation correctly uses function overloads to ensure type safety for different scenarios. The changes are well-tested, covering the new functionality across all supported file formats.\n\nMy review includes a suggestion to make the default value for the new option more explicit, which will improve code clarity and maintainability. I've also pointed out some code duplication in the new tests that could be refactored.",
