Later, if we see all the same bytes in the exact same order, we can treat it like a whole pointer again without ever risking a leak of the data bytes (that encode the offset into the allocation). This lifts the limitation that was discussed quite a bit in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/137280.\n\nFor a concrete piece of code that used to fail and now works properly consider this example doing a byte-for-byte memcpy in const without using intrinsics:\n```rust\nuse std::{mem::{self, MaybeUninit}, ptr};\n\ntype Byte = MaybeUninit<u8>;\n\nconst unsafe fn memcpy(dst: *mut Byte, src: *const Byte, n: usize) {\n    let mut i = 0;\n    while i < n {\n        *dst.add(i) = *src.add(i);\n        i += 1;\n    }\n}\n\nconst _MEMCPY: () = unsafe {\n    let ptr = &42;\n    let mut ptr2 = ptr::null::<i32>();\n    // Copy from ptr to ptr2.\n    memcpy(&mut ptr2 as *mut _ as *mut _, &ptr as *const _ as *const _, mem::size_of::<&i32>());\n    assert!(*ptr2 == 42);\n};\n```\nWhat makes this code tricky is that pointers are \"opaque blobs\" in const-eval, we cannot just let people look at the individual bytes since *we don't know what those bytes look like* -- that depends on the absolute address the pointed-to object will be placed at. The code above \"breaks apart\" a pointer into individual bytes, and then puts them back together in the same order elsewhere. This PR implements the logic to properly track how those individual bytes relate to the original pointer, and to recognize when they are in the right order again.\n\nWe still reject constants where the final value contains a not-fully-put-together pointer: I have no idea how one could construct an LLVM global where one byte is defined as \"the 3rd byte of a pointer to that other global over there\" -- and even if LLVM supports this somehow, we can leave implementing that to a future PR. It seems unlikely to me anyone would even want this, but who knows.^^\n\nThis also changes the behavior of Miri, by tracking the order of bytes with provenance and only considering a pointer to have valid provenance if all bytes are in the original order again. This is related to https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/558. It means one cannot implement XOR linked lists with strict provenance any more, which is however only of theoretical interest. Practically I am curious if anyone will show up with any code that Miri now complains about - that would be interesting data. Cc `@rust-lang/opsem`",

Open vscode with any code folder.\n2. Enable Copilot extension.\n3. Check the rate limit from `https://api.github.com/rate_limit` \n4. It fires 10 code scanning update request per second in an idle vscode instance.\n5. The requests didn't shown in vscode dev tool console or network tab.\n6. This quickly exhaust the GitHub API 5000 requests per hour limit if I open multiple projects.\n7.  This dramatically affect my work, cannot interact with GitHub just 10-15 mins after the limit reset.

                "body" : "@bdr99 Thank you for getting this in. It seems to connect just fine and I have verified setting the different modes seem to work. Some notes on missing/different functionality vs the app.\n\n(1) Vacation mode only allows to be set to On (I assume permanent). No option to set for specific number of days.\n\n(2) Missing \"Guest Mode\" which also has a number of days to set (1-99 in the app), but no \"On\" value.\n\n(3) Hotwater+ Works as expected and the entity is appropriately named, but the control in the UI just says \"Water Heater\"\n\nNone of these are needed, but just wanted to let you know the state. Overall, it works amazing!\n\nI will see how the energy usage and water availability change throughout the day and let you know.\n\nThank you again!",
