I've shared a link below to the AI checker that I've used.\n\nhttps://app.gptzero.me/documents/08974092-6a67-4555-a133-9883eee2e9aa/share\n\nPersonally, I'd like to think that this is a just a kid with good intentions striving to make a better internet, but LLMs are not the way to go about it. LLMs are just summarizing tools. They are not good at creating new ideas. They just summarize knowledge it already has already been trained by.\n\nBut then, things got real when he received a $50k donation to get this going, and now, he's just trying to handle it the best he can. Realistically, $50k is nowhere near enough manpower to bootstrap a new Internet layer, but, even so, there is entire community being built around Betanet. I've met some cool people and I'm sure you have too, but will this project turn into something real? Probably not. \n\nThe only really decent, concrete idea that has come from this is using a mock TLS connection to mask other protocols. Why not put that over Tor or I2p? I don't know. Everything else, the protocol upgradability, the financial incentives for routing, are not new. Many blockchains have an upgrade protocol more sophisticated than just release the update and hope people start running the new version. Financial incentives have been available for years using Althea (althea.net).",

This project is essentially trying to do the same thing, so why try to reinvent the wheel? By the way, I hope you're doing good in Iraq 😄.\n\nThank you for the kind words, I hope you're doing good as well! <3\n\nYou are correct, we can use Tor or I2P, it is indeed as good as Betanet, and might've be even better. But the thing is, the ISPs in Iraq monitor the users HEAVILY, they will know for sure if you're connected to a Tor or I2P node, the infrastructure of communication layers here in Iraq are implemented in such a way that the Iraqi national security (in other words the Iraqi version of the NSA & FBI but corrupt) will literally know your location because the ISPs here are always in a monitor-and-report mode. Now I am not saying that our censorship is at the extreme level such as Iran or North Korea, but it is at a, let's say, medium-level of censorship in which you cannot criticize a public official if they're corrupt, or else their corrupt police would be knocking your door. \n\nIraqi ministry of communications blocked the app Telegram entirely for a month because there was a leak regarding official corrupt documents, as well as citizen data.\n\nWhich is the reason of why I fully endorsed this type of project in the first place, it is a long shot in the dark, a massive project, if it hits, it would be beneficial for everyone. Just a basic freedom that people here need right now :)",

                "body" : "This PR implements a new GitHub Actions workflow `build-push.yml` that builds and pushes Docker images to Aliyun Container Registry when changes are pushed to the main branch.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Automatic triggering**: Activates on pushes to `main` branch and supports manual dispatch\n- **Conditional building**: Uses file change detection to only build when `api/**` or workflow files are modified\n- **Latest stable actions**: Updates all GitHub Actions to their newest stable versions for improved security and performance\n- **Registry integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Aliyun Container Registry using environment variables and secrets\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe workflow consists of two main jobs:\n\n1. **Change Detection**: Uses `dorny/paths-filter@v3` to detect relevant file changes\n2. **Build and Push**: Conditionally builds and pushes the API Docker image using the latest Docker actions\n\n## Action Version Updates\n\nAll GitHub Actions have been updated to their latest stable versions:\n- `actions/checkout@v3` → `@v4`\n- `docker/setup-buildx-action@v2` → `@v3` \n- `docker/login-action@v2` → `@v3`\n- `docker/metadata-action@v4` → `@v5`\n- `docker/build-push-action@v4` → `@v6`\n- `dorny/paths-filter@v2` → `@v3`\n\n## Environment Configuration\n\nThe workflow requires the following environment variables to be configured in the repository:\n\n**Repository Variables:**\n- `ALIYUN_REGISTRY` - Aliyun container registry URL\n- `API_IMAGE_NAME` - Target image name\n\n**Repository Secrets:**\n- `ALIYUN_REGISTRY_USER` - Registry username\n- `ALIYUN_REGISTRY_PWD` - Registry password\n\n## Workflow Relationship\n\nThis new workflow complements the existing `only-build.yml` workflow:\n- `only-build.yml`: Builds (but doesn't push) on non-main branches\n- `build-push.yml`: Builds and pushes on main branch\n\nThis ensures a complete CI/CD pipeline where feature branches are validated through build-only testing, while the main branch automatically deploys to the container registry.\n\nFixes #46.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

You can keep speaker consistency by either adding an audio prompt, or fixing the seed.\n\nSo one would think that by fixing the seed we would get the same voice each time, but this is demonstrably false at least with cpu and mps. Even with an expanded seed setting for modern devices like:\n\n```py\ndef set_seed(seed: int):\n    \"\"\"Sets the random seed for reproducibility.\"\"\"\n    random.seed(seed)\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)\n    if hasattr(torch.backends, \"cuda\") and torch.cuda.is_available():\n        torch.Generator(device=torch.device(\"cuda\")).manual_seed(seed)\n\n        torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)\n        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)\n\n        # Ensure deterministic behavior for cuDNN (if used)\n        torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True\n        torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False\n\n        if os.getenv(\"CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG\") is None:\n            os.environ[\"CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG\"] = \":4096:8\"\n    elif hasattr(torch.backends, \"mps\") and torch.backends.mps.is_available():\n        torch.Generator(device=torch.device(\"mps\")).manual_seed(seed)\n        torch.mps.manual_seed(seed)\n        # Enable deterministic behavior for MPS\n        os.environ[\"PYTORCH_MPS_DETERMINISTIC\"] = \"1\"\n    else:\n        torch.Generator(device=torch.device(\"cpu\")).manual_seed(seed)\n```\n\nThis does not work when run each time across multiple calls to `generate()` on the same instantiated Dia.from_pretrained (this is using the nari-labs/Dia-1.6B-0626 model).\n\nspecific use can be seen in https://github.com/robbiemu/bomdia in the src/components/audio_generator/tts.py file.\n\nI realize that I can generate from a list (and I'm about to see if making that is an improvement) instead of separate calls to generate per \"chunk\" of the transcript to generate, but I was also logging the seed for reproducibility/resumability and that doesn't seem possible.",

                "body" : "# Description\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nTypically in a Dapr Workflows App, the `Workflows` and `Activity` code are co-located and **registered** in the same App instance.\r\n\r\nAfter conversations with yaron, there is good reason to think that it should be possible to break this co-location, such that `Activities` can be registered on a different App instances to the `Workflow`, yet still have them interoperate. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThis would allow the isolation/ring fencing of compute & memory to the `Activities` which are separated from the compute & memory of the `Workflow`. In a k8s environment, this would mean a `deployment` for the main App which contains the registered `Workflow` and then another `deployment` which contains the registered `Activities`. `Activities` could then scale independently of the rest of the main Workflow App.\r\n\r\n### Challenge\r\n\r\nAs long as both apps share the same dapr `app-Id`, wfengine doesn't care that the workflows and activities are are not co-located. It's weird, but it works...\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem lies in that the internal workflow Actors and internal Activity Actors are **both loaded by default** on each sidecar. Therefore, during the running of a Workflow, eventually the placement service will try and schedule an Activity onto the App which only has the Workflows registered. The Workflow fails at this point with the message\r\n\r\n>  `dapr.workflow.failure.error_message\": \"Task '<ACTIVITY_NAME>' (#0) failed with an unhandled exception: No activity task named '<ACTIVITY_NAME>' was found.\",`\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nThis PoC attempts to change this **default**, such that a sidecar can either care about _both_ Workflows & Activities, or _only_ Workflows, or _only_ Activities. \r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nIn a complete solution, there would be a handshake between the Workflow Client SDK and the Workflow Engine to establish what is registered (Activities and/or Workflows), and then the sidecar would apply the desired settings to match. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of a complete solution, for this PoC, I've simply added two new arguments to the `dapr run` in order to manually generate the desired effect.\r\n\r\n- `--register-workflow-backend` (default `true`)\r\n- `--register-activity-backend` (default `true`)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese flags will respectively swap out the *real* Durable Task Workers with a new [No-Op Task worker](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/28097042c63800f1d4ebd83811decf867957ae81/pkg/runtime/wfengine/no_op_task_worker.go)\r\n\r\n## Issue reference\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe strive to have all PR being opened based on an issue, where the problem or feature have been discussed prior to implementation.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPlease reference the issue this PR will close: #_[issue number]_\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you've completed the relevant tasks for this PR, out of the following list:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code compiles correctly\r\n- [ ] Created/updated tests\r\n- [ ] Unit tests passing\r\n- [ ] End-to-end tests passing\r\n- [ ] Extended the documentation / Created issue in the <https://github.com/dapr/docs/> repo: dapr/docs#_[issue number]_\r\n- [ ] Specification has been updated / Created issue in the <https://github.com/dapr/docs/> repo: dapr/docs#_[issue number]_\r\n- [ ] Provided sample for the feature / Created issue in the <https://github.com/dapr/docs/> repo: dapr/docs#_[issue number]_\r\n",

In Supabase Dashboard I dont see a \"last signed in\" value. \n\nWhen clicking the magic link a confirmation code is added as query parameter.\n\nHowever, when I send the magic link via supabase Dashboard the query parameters are different and the login seems to work. However still no redirect is happening.\n\n### What is Expected?\nUser clicks on the magic link, gets signed in and is redirected.\n\n### What is actually happening?\nLogin is not happening and user is stuck on confirm page",

In Supabase Dashboard I dont see a \"last signed in\" value. \n\nWhen clicking the magic link a confirmation code is added as query parameter.\n\nHowever, when I send the magic link via supabase Dashboard the query parameters are different and the login seems to work. However still no redirect is happening.\n\n### What is Expected?\nUser clicks on the magic link, gets signed in and is redirected.\n\n### What is actually happening?\nLogin is not happening and user is stuck on confirm page",

This occurred because the monitoring modules import `psutil` but it wasn't listed in the production requirements.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe backend application uses `psutil` for system monitoring in two key files:\n- `backend/app/routers/metrics.py` - Imports psutil for system metrics endpoints\n- `backend/app/monitoring/prometheus_metrics.py` - Uses psutil for collecting CPU, memory, and disk metrics\n\nHowever, `psutil` was only listed in `backend/requirements-test.txt` and missing from `backend/requirements.txt`, causing the application to fail during startup when trying to import these modules.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded `psutil==7.0.0` to `backend/requirements.txt` in the \"Monitoring and Logging\" section, using the same version already specified in the test requirements for consistency.\n\n## Testing\n\nVerified the fix by:\n- Confirming the original import error was reproduced\n- Installing the updated requirements and testing all affected imports\n- Running system metrics collection to ensure functionality works correctly\n- Simulating backend startup to confirm the ModuleNotFoundError is resolved\n\nThe backend should now start successfully without dependency errors.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/aluiziorenato/ml_project/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n",
