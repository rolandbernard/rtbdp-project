                "body" : "This PR resolves a cascade of issues originating from legacy data inconsistencies in the apipayments table. The fix implements a self-healing mechanism that automatically cleans up corrupted data over time, resolving stuck pending payments, database crashes, and Core Lightning log spam without requiring any manual user intervention.\r\nThe Bug\r\n\r\nA legacy bug in the payment creation logic could create two distinct records for a single transaction:\r\n\r\n    A \"buggy\" record where checking_id was an internal database UUID.\r\n\r\n    A \"correct\" record where checking_id was the proper payment hash.\r\n\r\nThis data corruption led to a chain of failures:\r\n\r\n    Stuck Payments & CLN Errors: When a status check was performed on a \"buggy\" record, its UUID was sent to the Core Lightning node, which correctly rejected it with an Invalid parameter payment_hash error. This caused the payment to be stuck as \"pending\" indefinitely in the UI and spammed the node's logs.\r\n\r\n    Database IntegrityError: Initial attempts to fix this by simply updating the buggy record's checking_id would fail with a UniqueViolationError. The database correctly prevented the update because it would make the buggy record an exact duplicate of the \"correct\" record that already existed. This crash would halt the background payment checker task.\r\n\r\n    Database UndefinedColumnError: An attempt to delete the duplicate buggy record failed due to a simple typo (wallet instead of wallet_id) in the DELETE statement's WHERE clause.\r\n\r\nThe Fix\r\n\r\nThis fix is implemented across two commits that work together to create a robust, self-healing system:\r\n\r\n    Self-Healing Logic (services/payments.py):\r\n    The core of the solution is in the update_pending_payment function. It now acts as a \"heal-on-read\" mechanism. When it encounters a potentially buggy record (where checking_id != payment_hash):\r\n\r\n        It first queries for a \"correct\" duplicate record.\r\n\r\n        If a correct duplicate exists, the buggy record is safely deleted.\r\n\r\n        If no duplicate exists, the buggy record is repaired in-memory before its status is checked.\r\n\r\n        This entire process is wrapped in a try/except block to ensure that an error processing one payment does not crash the entire background task.\r\n\r\n    CRUD Typo Correction (crud/payments.py):\r\n    The final blocker was a typo in the delete_wallet_payment and get_wallet_payment functions. The SQL query was incorrectly referencing a column named wallet instead of the correct wallet_id. This commit corrects the typo, allowing the self-healing logic in the service layer to function as intended.\r\n\r\nAI Assistance and Production Validation\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this complex issue was debugged and resolved in close collaboration with a generative AI assistant (Google's Gemini). The AI played a significant role in analyzing the chain of error logs across multiple system layers, tracing the logic through the LNbits codebase, and iteratively refining the final self-healing solution.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this exact code is currently running in a production environment for the [Lightning Goats](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Flightninggoats.com) project. Since deployment, it has been confirmed to resolve all three classes of errors: the Core Lightning Invalid parameter logs have ceased, the database IntegrityError and UndefinedColumnError crashes have been eliminated, and stuck pending payments are being correctly updated.",

Thank you for the thorough review\\!",

                "body" : "## Summary\nFixes issue #299 where the Ollama client fails with `'generator' object has no attribute 'raw_response'` error when using `stream=True`.\n\n## Problem\nWhen streaming was enabled in the Ollama client:\n1. The client returned a generator object from the Ollama API\n2. This generator was incorrectly wrapped in `GeneratorOutput.raw_response` \n3. During error handling, the generator object was assigned to the `raw_response` field\n4. Later code tried to access `.raw_response` on the generator object itself, causing the error\n\n## Solution\n1. **Modified `OllamaClient.parse_chat_completion`**: Return raw generators directly for streaming cases instead of wrapping them in `GeneratorOutput`\n2. **Updated `Generator` error handling**: Added type checking to prevent generator objects from being assigned to `raw_response` fields during exception handling\n3. **Enhanced type safety**: Added support for both `typing.Generator` and `collections.abc.AsyncGenerator` types\n\n## Changes Made\n- `adalflow/components/model_client/ollama_client.py`: Modified streaming response handling\n- `adalflow/core/generator.py`: Fixed error handling in both sync and async methods  \n- `tests/test_ollama_client.py`: Updated tests to reflect correct streaming behavior\n\n## Test Results\nAll existing tests pass, including the updated streaming tests that now correctly expect raw generators instead of wrapped `GeneratorOutput` objects.\n\n## Compatibility\n- ✅ Non-streaming responses: Unchanged behavior\n- ✅ Other model clients: No impact (changes isolated to Ollama)\n- ✅ Existing functionality: All tests passing\n- ✅ Architecture compliance: Follows existing patterns for streaming responses\n\n## Test plan\n- [x] Verify sync streaming works correctly\n- [x] Verify async streaming works correctly  \n- [x] Verify non-streaming functionality unchanged\n- [x] Verify all existing tests pass\n- [x] Test error handling scenarios\n\nCloses #299",

Equipment detection test\n2. Material detection (skips if no professions)\n3. Bag detection test\n4. Recipe detection (skips if no professions)\n5. Potion detection test\n6. Whisper mode test (sends to self)\n7. Social features simulation (GZ/RIP probability testing)\n\nSafety Features:\n- All whisper tests sent to player themselves\n- Social tests simulate without sending to guild\n- Clear [SMOKE TEST] prefixes on all test messages\n- Summary report with detailed metrics\n\nPerfect for post-deployment verification without disturbing guild members.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
