                "body" : "Всем привет! В силу того, что данное расширение все сложнее заставить работать (спасибо, Гугл), я набросал альтернативное расширение под названием \"Менеджер PAC Прокси\": [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pac-proxy-manager/jkdcbabhagklbkoidneelnhbhcliekak?authuser=0&hl=ru](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pac-proxy-manager/jkdcbabhagklbkoidneelnhbhcliekak?authuser=0&hl=ru)\nСуть его та же (загружаешь любой PAC скрипт, указываешь свои прокси, также можно добавлять исключения по доменам), но ни в названии, ни в функционале нет привязки к обходу блокировок, что делает его более универсальным и устойчивым к блокировкам. В контексте обхода блокировок РФ, нужно сделать всего два шага:\n1. Добавить любой PAC скрипт обхода блокировок, например Anticensority: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anticensority/generated-pac-scripts/master/anticensority.pac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anticensority/generated-pac-scripts/master/anticensority.pac)\n2. Добавить свои прокси\n3. Наслаждаться, что заблокированные сайты снова работают\n\nТакже стоит отметить, что это расширение гораздо более легковесно и требует всего 3 базовых пермишна. Оно не знает, на какие сайты вы заходите и к каким URL обращаетесь, и работает быстрее.\n\nЕсли вам оно помогло, буду благодарен 5 звездам на странице Chrome Store 🙂 \nЕсли нет, то открыт к обратной связи: [https://github.com/ilyachase/pac-proxy-manager-extension/issues/new](https://github.com/ilyachase/pac-proxy-manager-extension/issues/new)\n\nВсем добра и свободного сёрфинга!",
