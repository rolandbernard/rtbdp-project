                    "description" : "\r\nSonarQube Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms. Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nFor those requiring US-based hosting, [SonarQube Cloud US](https://sonarqube.us/) offers the perfect alternative. If you need data residency outside the US or within the EU, [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) with this GitHub app is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action? You can [explore current Open Source projects in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects?sort=-analysis_date) that are using the [Clean as You Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/) methodology.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for? SonarQube Cloud helps you consistently deliver cleaner, secure software that future developers will appreciate and your users will love. Start writing Clean Code.

I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the ragflow team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThe \"Unauthorized model: bge-m3@OpenAI-API-Compatible\" error usually means the model isn't correctly registered under the OpenAI-API-Compatible factory in your conf/llm_factories.json. Make sure you add bge-m3 to the \"llm\" array for the OpenAI-API-Compatible section, using the right format (including llm_name, model_type, base_url, and an API key placeholder like \"no-key-need\" if your VLLM server doesn't require authentication). The model name must match exactly what the backend expects. After editing the config, restart your backend service for changes to take effect. Leaving the API key empty or mismatching names will cause this error. If you're running inside Docker, use the host's internal IP for base_url instead of localhost or 127.0.0.1. More details are in [this thread](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/issues/8343#issuecomment-2982827038) and [config example](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/d874683ae4bc3446464fc406a9b4e5da8f78a8a7/conf/llm_factories.json).\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

This affects readability and consistency in the published documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Problems Identified**\n\n1. **Improper heading syntax**  \n   - `## Key Feature: Verbosity Parameter` is missing a blank line after the heading.  \n   - `### Example: Using ‘medium’ verbosity setting In this example, ...` has the heading and body text on the same line.  \n     - Correct markdown requires the heading to be on its own line, followed by a newline before the paragraph.\n\n2. **Inline list items instead of proper bullet list**  \n   - In the “verbosity parameter has three levels” section, `- Low: ... - Medium: ... - High: ...` is written inline without newlines, so it does not render as a markdown list.  \n     - Each list item should be on its own line with a blank line before the list.\n\n---\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n### **Proposed Fix**\n\n- Add a blank line after all markdown headers.\n- Ensure each header is followed by body text on a new line.\n- Rewrite the verbosity levels section as a proper list:\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Wrapping the handler execution in a goroutine.\r\n2 Using a `select` statement to handle three possible outcomes:\r\n\r\n    - Handler completes successfully.\r\n    - Handler panics (panic is propagated).\r\n    - Timeout occurs, triggering cfg.OnTimeout if set, or returning fiber.ErrRequestTimeout.. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis change guarantees that:\r\n- The timeout is respected in real time.\r\n- Handlers have the opportunity to observe context cancellation if needed.\r\n- Panics are safely propagated without losing stack traces.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #3671\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes introduced\r\n\r\nList the new features or adjustments introduced in this pull request. Provide details on benchmarks, documentation updates, changelog entries, and if applicable, the migration guide.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Benchmarks: Describe any performance benchmarks and improvements related to the changes.\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update: Detail the updates made to the documentation and links to the changed files.\r\n- [ ] Changelog/What's New: Include a summary of the additions for the upcoming release notes.\r\n- [ ] Migration Guide: If necessary, provide a guide or steps for users to migrate their existing code to accommodate these changes.\r\n- [ ] API Alignment with Express: Explain how the changes align with the Express API.\r\n- [ ] API Longevity: Discuss the steps taken to ensure that the new or updated APIs are consistent and not prone to breaking changes.\r\n- [ ] Examples: Provide examples demonstrating the new features or changes in action.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improvement to existing features and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Documentation update (changes to documentation)\r\n- [ ] Performance improvement (non-breaking change which improves efficiency)\r\n- [ ] Code consistency (non-breaking change which improves code reliability and robustness)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore you submit your pull request, please make sure you meet these requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Followed the inspiration of the Express.js framework for new functionalities, making them similar in usage.\r\n- [] Conducted a self-review of the code and provided comments for complex or critical parts.\r\n- [ ] Updated the documentation in the `/docs/` directory for [Fiber's documentation](https://docs.gofiber.io/).\r\n- [ ] Added or updated unit tests to validate the effectiveness of the changes or new features.\r\n- [ ] Ensured that new and existing unit tests pass locally with the changes.\r\n- [ ] Verified that any new dependencies are essential and have been agreed upon by the maintainers/community.\r\n- [ ] Aimed for optimal performance with minimal allocations in the new code.\r\n- [ ] Provided benchmarks for the new code to analyze and improve upon.\r\n\r\n## Commit formatting\r\n\r\nPlease use emojis in commit messages for an easy way to identify the purpose or intention of a commit.

I'll skip the review since this is shadcn/ui code. \n\nJust a quick note for context: shadcn/ui components are typically copied into projects and can be customized as needed, but I respect your decision to keep them as-is. If you encounter any issues with table rendering in the future, feel free to reach out!\n\n\n\n🐰💭 (thoughtful - learning something new about the project's UI component approach!)\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>✏️ Learnings added</summary>\n\n```\nLearnt from: DW225\nPR: DW225/ree-board#465\nFile: components/ui/table.tsx:9-15\nTimestamp: 2025-08-17T14:36:28.819Z\nLearning: The project uses shadcn/ui components which are copied into the components/ui/ directory.

                "body" : "Ok Guys tis @/!%** Paladin  is driving me crazy!\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a configurable policy to prefer Blessing of Sanctuary over Blessing of Kings on tanks, and hardens the casting logic so Kings won’t overwrite Sanctuary (and vice-versa). \r\nIn WotLK, Sanctuary provides 3% damage reduction and returns resources on avoidance, making it a strong tank blessing; Kings remains a universal fallback. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n- Many groups want Sanctuary on tanks (mitigation + resource return), Kings for everyone else. Playerbots previously defaulted to Kings in some paths or kept Sanctuary from replacing Kings immediately.\r\n- I also ensure the “one Paladin blessing per target” rule is respected by preventing accidental overwrites. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What changed\r\n\r\n1. New policy switch\r\n\r\n- AiPlayerbot.Paladin.SanctuaryPriority (default 1)\r\n\r\n- 1 => Prefer Sanctuary on tanks (if learned), Kings elsewhere.\r\n- 0 => Prefer Kings; the Sanctuary action won’t auto-apply.\r\n\r\n2. Sanctuary action is “strict”\r\n\r\n- The Sanctuary action never falls back to Kings. If the target isn’t a tank (or the spell isn’t known), it does nothing and lets the Kings action handle the rest.\r\n\r\n3. Allow replacement when prioritized\r\n\r\n- When SanctuaryPriority=1, the Sanctuary action targets party/raid members missing Sanctuary only, even if they already have Kings, so the tank gets Sanctuary immediately (Kings => Sanctuary upgrade).\r\n\r\n4. Kings won’t overwrite Sanctuary\r\n\r\n- The Kings action’s target filter now excludes Sanctuary (mono + greater), preventing Kings from replacing an already-applied Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n5. Main-Tank focus for fast application\r\n\r\n- If SanctuaryPriority=1 and the Main Tank lacks Sanctuary, the Sanctuary action forces its target to the MT before casting. This avoids selector ordering issues (master/healer first) and guarantees prompt application to the tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n```\r\n# Paladin — Sanctuary policy on tanks\r\n# 1 = Sanctuary on tanks if learned (fallback Kings)\r\n# 0 = Kings has priority; Sanctuary is not used automatically\r\n# Default: 1\r\nAiPlayerbot.Paladin.SanctuaryPriority = 1\r\n```\r\nWorks alongside Strict Role Mode (OFF/ON/AUTO) and Greater/Single upgrade logic; no change required to existing settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes:\r\n\r\n**Selector changes : **\r\n\r\n**Sanctuary GetTargetValue():**\r\n\r\n- Priority ON => match  without Sanctuary  (allows replacing Kings).\r\n- Priority OFF => legacy behavior (requires neither Kings nor Sanctuary).\r\n\r\n**Kings GetTargetValue() now excludes both Kings and Sanctuary.**\r\n\r\n**Decision function**\r\n\r\n- GetActualBlessingOfSanctuary(...) returns Sanctuary only for tanks (or the explicit Main Tank), otherwise empty (no cast). No implicit Kings fallback here.\r\n\r\n**Execute path**\r\n\r\n**Sanctuary Execute(...) optionally retargets the Main Tank if he lacks Sanctuary, then applies normal Greater vs Single upgrade with reagent handling.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acceptance tests\r\n\r\n**Default (priority=1)**\r\n\r\n**Group with Prot Paladin (bstats), Warrior Prot, others:**\r\n\r\n- Everyone receives Kings (Greater when appropriate).\r\n- Warrior Prot’s Kings is immediately replaced by Sanctuary.\r\n- Subsequent Kings passes do not overwrite Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Priority=0**\r\n\r\n- Same setup: tanks receive Kings; Sanctuary is not applied automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n**No Sanctuary learned**\r\n\r\n- Priority=1 or 0: Kings behavior unchanged; no Sanctuary attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\n- Default is priority=1, which aligns with common WotLK tank buff practice (Sanctuary on tanks; Kings elsewhere). No behavior change for non-tank targets. The change is localized and low-risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Why Sanctuary?**\r\n\r\n- Greater Blessing of Sanctuary on WotLK: 3% damage taken reduction; +10% Strength/Stamina; returns mana/rage/runic power on block/parry/dodge. \r\n- Greater Blessing of Kings (WotLK): +10% stats; only one Paladin blessing per target at a time. \r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing and tests.",
