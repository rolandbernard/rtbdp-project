I was running unit tests from the IDE and assumed everything was working. Unfortunately, one of the unit tests was referring to the incorrect property `packageName` instead of `name`, so it was broken. Fortunately, the function in utils.js was referring to the correct property, so the end users aren't affected.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't biome catch this? Because we [disabled](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/blob/42c3c6c173096f085fe29c5bd589658b820d8df6/biome.json#L29) linting for unit tests.

Your implementation of the `Figure` interface and the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle` classes is correct, with precise area calculations, robust error handling, and proper use of TypeScript features. The `getInfo` function returns the expected output format, and all constructors validate input as required. No critical or blocking issues remain. Excellent job addressing previous feedback and ensuring your code is clean, readable, and fully compliant with the assignment. Keep up the great work!\n\n***\n\n✨ Please rate this review in the Platform's notification center[^1].

Now it's time to merge our work. :tada: To wrap up, let's learn about two limited-access Copilot features that can speed up our pull requests!\n\n#### Copilot pull request summaries\n\nTypically, you would review your notes and commit messages then summarize them for your pull request description. This may take some time, especially if commit messages are inconsistent or code is not documented well. Fortunately, Copilot can consider all changes in the pull request and provide the important highlights, and with references too!\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This feature is not available in **GitHub Copilot Free**. [[docs]](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-summary-with-github-copilot)\n\n#### Copilot code review\n\nMore eyes on our work is always useful so let's ask Copilot to do a first pass before we do a normal peer review process. Copilot is great at catching common mistakes that are fixed by simple adjustments, but please remember to use it responsibly.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This feature is not available in **GitHub Copilot Free**. [[docs]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review)\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Summarize and review a PR with Copilot\n\nBoth **Copilot pull request summaries** and **Copilot code review** have limited access, so this activity is mostly optional. If you have access, go ahead and try them though! If not, you can skip the optional steps.\n\n1. In a web browser, open another tab and navigate to your exercise repository.\n\n1. You might notice a **notification banner** suggesting to create a new pull request. Click that or use the **Pull Requests** tab at the top to create a new pull request. Please use the following details:\n\n   - **base:** `main`\n   - **compare:** `accelerate-with-copilot`\n   - **title:** `Add registration validation and more activities`\n\n1. (Optional) In the **Add a description** area, enter edit mode if needed, then click the **Copilot actions** icon and **Summary** action. After a moment, Copilot will add a description. :memo:\n\n   <img alt=\"Copilot summarize button \" width=\"300px\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc5fab4-db03-4ab8-8a16-cdd71ec2ded0\">\n\n1. (Optional) In the right side information panel at the top, locate the **Reviewers** section and click the **Request** button next to a **Copilot icon**. Wait a moment for Copilot to add a review comment to your pull request!\n\n   <img alt=\"Copilot review button\" width=\"300px\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39b15002-a235-4c25-b09d-6a8097e27b62\">\n\n   > **Tip:** Notice a log entry that Copilot was requested for a review.\n\n1. At the bottom, press the **Merge pull request** button. Nice work! You are all done! :tada:\n\n1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and post a final review of this lesson!\n",

While functional, it doesn’t provide a great user experience or intuitive data visualization.\n\n<img width=\"1171\" height=\"209\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/746b7025-1a46-402d-8ee8-18c846801b1c\" />  \n\n**Proposed Enhancement:**\n\n* Redesign the Training page with a **styled, responsive table** for metrics.\n* Add an **interactive chart** (e.g., bar or line) to clearly visualize accuracy vs error.\n* Ensure the layout is **mobile-friendly and responsive**, so the table and chart adapt well to smaller screens.\n* This will make the page more engaging, professional, and user-friendly.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\n* A modernized Training page with a clean and responsive layout.\n* Better readability of metrics across devices.\n* Interactive graph for quick insights.\n\n**Suggested Level:**\nLevel 2 \n\n@reshamsai150, please consider assigning this issue to me as part of GSSoC’25.\nAlso, I would like to clarify whether styling should be done using **plain CSS** (custom styles) or if **Tailwind CSS** is allowed in this project for consistency and faster development.",

Comments like this may be safely removed, if you want.\r\n\r\nIf you are opening this pull request from Github's web interface, you can use the 'preview' button to see what your pull request will look like to others.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for pull requests:\r\n-Keep your changes limited to one specific issue or change, plus the bare minimum related work to make that happen.\r\n-A good rule of thumb is that most pull requests are less than 500 lines of changes.\r\n-You can open extra pull requests to separate out portions of an intended change, ask if you're unsure. We're happy to work with you or advise the best way to get your PR merged.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\nFeatures \"ASCII overmap shows terrain below air as a '.' similarly to how it does so with regular vision\"\r\n\r\n<!-- This section should consist of exactly one line, edit the one above.\r\n1. Replace the word \"Category\" with one of these specific categories: Features, Content, Interface, Mods, Balance, Bugfixes, Performance, Infrastructure, Build, I18N.\r\n2. Replace the text inside the quotes with a brief description of your changes.\r\nOr if you don't want a changelog entry, replace the whole line with just the word \"None\" (with no quotes).\r\nSome examples:\r\n1. None\r\n2. Features \"In-game Armor sprite change\"\r\n3. Interface \"Show crafting failure chances in the crafting interface\"\r\nFor more on the meaning of each category, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/doc/CHANGELOG_GUIDELINES.md\r\nIf merged, your summary will be added to the project changelog:\r\nhttps://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/data/changelog.txt -->\r\n\r\n#### Purpose of change\r\n3D vision is cool, no 3D vision on overmap sad\r\n<!-- With a few sentences, describe your reasons for making this change.\r\nIf it relates to an existing issue, you can link it with a # followed by the GitHub issue number, like #1234.\r\nWhen you submit a pull request that completely resolves an issue, use [Github's closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)\r\nto automatically close the issue once your pull request is merged.\r\nIf there is no related issue, explain here what issue, feature, or other concern you are addressing.  If this is a bugfix, include steps to reproduce the original bug, so your fix can be verified. -->\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution\r\nEnable 3D overmap vision on the overmap for ASCII aiming for similar results to map::draw_from_above\r\nAdds support for overmap sprites with alpha usage, currently the logic is disabled unless using `\"supports_overmap_transparency\" : true` in the tileset or overriding it with a debug setting for testing. UNTIL TILESETS GET BACKPORTED FOR 0.I NO TILESETS IN THE MAIN REPO SHOULD USE THIS TO MAKE BACKPORTING SMOOTHER. Hence the debug option so peeps can sprite stuff ahead of time and play around with it.\r\nTilesets fallback.png want a background adding bc they currently lack one and with this enabled you can see through them\r\nCurrently works with a minor kink in the ASCII implementation specifically for the highlighted cursor tile, isn't quite ready to merge tho\r\n<!-- How does the feature work, or how does this fix a bug?  The easier you make your solution to understand, the faster it can get merged. -->\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain any alternative solutions, different approaches, or possibilities you've considered using to solve the same problem. -->\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nWill add screenshots of the ASCII implementation and the sprite implementation with some modified MSX sprites\r\nWill add profiling of drawing the extra zlevels for sprites as to whether this needs guarding with a proper check once we start using it or whether it seems fine to leave as is (haven't profiled yet but surprisingly haven't noticed a difference to norm while testing it)\r\n<!-- Describe what steps you took to test that this PR resolved the bug or added the feature, and what tests you performed to make sure it didn't cause any regressions.  Also, include testing suggestions for reviewers and maintainers. See TESTING_YOUR_CHANGES.md -->\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context (such as mock-ups, proof of concepts or screenshots) about the feature or bugfix here. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--README: Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is released under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 license.\r\nThe code and content of the game are free to use, modify, and redistribute for any purpose whatsoever.\r\nBy contributing to the project you agree to the terms of the license and that any contribution you make will also be covered by the same license.\r\nSee http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ for details. -->\r\n",

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work? Only paid users can view reports and post statuses/comments. ",
