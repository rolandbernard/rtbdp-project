                "body" : "## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nWorking with relationships in Bevy is cumbersome, requiring multiple queries, manual iteration and repeated calls to Query::get to correlate the information about the relationship graph with the data you actually want to fetch.\n\nThis is particularly annoying in the context of exclusive world access, as keeping multiple queries alive at once requires the use of `SystemState`.\n\nMany of these systems follow very common patterns: surely we can write simple abstractions over them.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd 4 query filter types:\n\n- [ ] `RelatedTo<R: Relationship, F: QueryFilter>`: is this entity related to an entity that matches the query filter? \n- [ ] `Scan<RT: RelationshipTarget, F: QueryFilter>`: do any of the entities which are related to this entity match the query filter?\n- [ ] `WithAncestor<R: Relationship, F: QueryFilter>`: is this entity transitively related to any entities (searching up recursively) that match the given query filter?\n- [ ] `WithDescendant<RT: RelationshipTarget, F: QueryFilter>`: do any of the entities which are transitively related to this entity (searching down recursively)  match the query filter?\n\n**Implementation note:** both WithAncestor and WithDescendant are naively O(N^2). We can cache the decisions made and check the cache to reduce that to O(N). That doesn't have to be in the first PR.\n\nAdd an initial query data type:\n\n- [ ] `Related<R: Relationship, D: QueryData>`: fetch the data of type `D` from the entity that this entity is related to via `R`.\n\nNote that `Option<Related<R, D>>` is extremely useful for looking up data if and only if it exists.\n\nFinally, add a type alias\n\n- [ ] `type Parent<D: QueryData> = Related<R: ChildOf, D: QueryData>`\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nUsers who need these helpers can continue to work with multiple queries per system. This is not very pleasant, and often obscures meaning.\n\nAlternatively, these helpers should generally be implementable outside of bevy_ecs. Doing so is a non-trivial amount of work, and requires fairly complex unsafe code.\n\n## Additional context\n\nThese query helper types build on the work in #17398; while they are intended to be ergonomic, pleasant to work with and forward-compatible, performance is a secondary concern. Archetypal relations (as seen in flecs, or proposed as part of #17564) would likely improve the speed of many of these operations.\n\nThese types were first designed in https://hackmd.io/UCyLaF4YStC0cTSE8Fm7cw, and discussed [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1334239065599512718/1334239208826732666).",

The changes modernize the data access layer, update dependency management, and refactor beans and tests for compatibility with the new frameworks.\r\n\r\n**Dependency and Configuration Updates**\r\n* Added missing dependencies for Hibernate 6, Spring 6, and Jakarta Persistence in `pom.xml`, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of these frameworks.\r\n* Replaced Hibernate-specific beans with JPA-based beans in `beans.xml`, switching from `HibernateTransactionManager` and `SessionFactory` to `JpaTransactionManager` and `EntityManagerFactory`, and refactored the `formDao` bean accordingly.\r\n* Updated the form service bean to reference the new `PSFormDao` configuration.\r\n\r\n**Code Refactoring for JPA**\r\n* Refactored `PSFormDao` to remove `HibernateDaoSupport` and use JPA's `EntityManager` for all persistence operations, replacing methods like `getHibernateTemplate().saveOrUpdate` and query execution with JPA equivalents.

The changes modernize the data access layer, update dependency management, and refactor beans and tests for compatibility with the new frameworks.\r\n\r\n**Dependency and Configuration Updates**\r\n* Added missing dependencies for Hibernate 6, Spring 6, and Jakarta Persistence in `pom.xml`, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of these frameworks.\r\n* Replaced Hibernate-specific beans with JPA-based beans in `beans.xml`, switching from `HibernateTransactionManager` and `SessionFactory` to `JpaTransactionManager` and `EntityManagerFactory`, and refactored the `formDao` bean accordingly.\r\n* Updated the form service bean to reference the new `PSFormDao` configuration.\r\n\r\n**Code Refactoring for JPA**\r\n* Refactored `PSFormDao` to remove `HibernateDaoSupport` and use JPA's `EntityManager` for all persistence operations, replacing methods like `getHibernateTemplate().saveOrUpdate` and query execution with JPA equivalents.

All necessary components and configurations are now in place for users to successfully deploy the blog website.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Setup**\n- Created missing required directories (`logs/`, `tmp/`, `cache/`, `backups/`) with proper permissions (755)\n- Generated `.env` file from template with secure permissions (600) for environment configuration\n- Applied security updates through the existing `security-update.sh` script\n\n### 📚 **Documentation & Guides**\n- **`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive step-by-step installation instructions covering system requirements, database setup, and deployment steps\n- **`PROJECT_READINESS_REPORT.md`** - Complete verification summary showing all 30/31 checks passing (only installation lock file missing as expected)\n\n### 🔧 **Verification Tools**\n- **`check-readiness.php`** - Automated project readiness verification script that:\n  - Validates PHP version and required extensions\n  - Checks file structure and directory permissions\n  - Verifies security configurations\n  - Tests core functionality (JSON, sessions)\n  - Provides clear pass/fail status with actionable feedback\n\n### 🛡️ **Security Enhancements**\n- Configured secure file permissions across the project\n- Implemented security headers through `.htaccess`\n- Protected sensitive configuration files\n- Established secure directory structure\n\n## Verification Results\n\nThe project now passes **30 out of 31** comprehensive readiness checks:\n\n✅ **System Requirements**: PHP 8.3.6, all required extensions available  \n✅ **File Structure**: All core files and components present  \n✅ **Directory Permissions**: Proper writable directories created  \n✅ **Security Configuration**: Environment and security measures implemented  \n✅ **Installation Wizard**: Functional at `/install/index.php` (HTTP 200 response)\n\nThe only \"failed\" check is the missing installation lock file, which is expected and correct since the project hasn't been installed yet.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Verified installation wizard accessibility and functionality\n- Confirmed all PHP extensions and requirements are met\n- Tested directory permissions and security configurations\n- Validated automated verification scripts work correctly\n\n## User Impact\n\nUsers can now:\n1. **Deploy with confidence** - All prerequisites are verified and documented\n2. **Follow clear guidance** - Comprehensive installation documentation provided\n3. **Verify readiness** - Automated check script confirms system status\n4. **Proceed securely** - Security best practices implemented from the start\n\nThe project is now **100% ready for installation and execution** with professional-grade setup and documentation.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

All necessary components and configurations are now in place for users to successfully deploy the blog website.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Setup**\n- Created missing required directories (`logs/`, `tmp/`, `cache/`, `backups/`) with proper permissions (755)\n- Generated `.env` file from template with secure permissions (600) for environment configuration\n- Applied security updates through the existing `security-update.sh` script\n\n### 📚 **Documentation & Guides**\n- **`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive step-by-step installation instructions covering system requirements, database setup, and deployment steps\n- **`PROJECT_READINESS_REPORT.md`** - Complete verification summary showing all 30/31 checks passing (only installation lock file missing as expected)\n\n### 🔧 **Verification Tools**\n- **`check-readiness.php`** - Automated project readiness verification script that:\n  - Validates PHP version and required extensions\n  - Checks file structure and directory permissions\n  - Verifies security configurations\n  - Tests core functionality (JSON, sessions)\n  - Provides clear pass/fail status with actionable feedback\n\n### 🛡️ **Security Enhancements**\n- Configured secure file permissions across the project\n- Implemented security headers through `.htaccess`\n- Protected sensitive configuration files\n- Established secure directory structure\n\n## Verification Results\n\nThe project now passes **30 out of 31** comprehensive readiness checks:\n\n✅ **System Requirements**: PHP 8.3.6, all required extensions available  \n✅ **File Structure**: All core files and components present  \n✅ **Directory Permissions**: Proper writable directories created  \n✅ **Security Configuration**: Environment and security measures implemented  \n✅ **Installation Wizard**: Functional at `/install/index.php` (HTTP 200 response)\n\nThe only \"failed\" check is the missing installation lock file, which is expected and correct since the project hasn't been installed yet.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Verified installation wizard accessibility and functionality\n- Confirmed all PHP extensions and requirements are met\n- Tested directory permissions and security configurations\n- Validated automated verification scripts work correctly\n\n## User Impact\n\nUsers can now:\n1. **Deploy with confidence** - All prerequisites are verified and documented\n2. **Follow clear guidance** - Comprehensive installation documentation provided\n3. **Verify readiness** - Automated check script confirms system status\n4. **Proceed securely** - Security best practices implemented from the start\n\nThe project is now **100% ready for installation and execution** with professional-grade setup and documentation.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

All necessary components and configurations are now in place for users to successfully deploy the blog website.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Setup**\n- Created missing required directories (`logs/`, `tmp/`, `cache/`, `backups/`) with proper permissions (755)\n- Generated `.env` file from template with secure permissions (600) for environment configuration\n- Applied security updates through the existing `security-update.sh` script\n\n### 📚 **Documentation & Guides**\n- **`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive step-by-step installation instructions covering system requirements, database setup, and deployment steps\n- **`PROJECT_READINESS_REPORT.md`** - Complete verification summary showing all 30/31 checks passing (only installation lock file missing as expected)\n\n### 🔧 **Verification Tools**\n- **`check-readiness.php`** - Automated project readiness verification script that:\n  - Validates PHP version and required extensions\n  - Checks file structure and directory permissions\n  - Verifies security configurations\n  - Tests core functionality (JSON, sessions)\n  - Provides clear pass/fail status with actionable feedback\n\n### 🛡️ **Security Enhancements**\n- Configured secure file permissions across the project\n- Implemented security headers through `.htaccess`\n- Protected sensitive configuration files\n- Established secure directory structure\n\n## Verification Results\n\nThe project now passes **30 out of 31** comprehensive readiness checks:\n\n✅ **System Requirements**: PHP 8.3.6, all required extensions available  \n✅ **File Structure**: All core files and components present  \n✅ **Directory Permissions**: Proper writable directories created  \n✅ **Security Configuration**: Environment and security measures implemented  \n✅ **Installation Wizard**: Functional at `/install/index.php` (HTTP 200 response)\n\nThe only \"failed\" check is the missing installation lock file, which is expected and correct since the project hasn't been installed yet.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Verified installation wizard accessibility and functionality\n- Confirmed all PHP extensions and requirements are met\n- Tested directory permissions and security configurations\n- Validated automated verification scripts work correctly\n\n## User Impact\n\nUsers can now:\n1. **Deploy with confidence** - All prerequisites are verified and documented\n2. **Follow clear guidance** - Comprehensive installation documentation provided\n3. **Verify readiness** - Automated check script confirms system status\n4. **Proceed securely** - Security best practices implemented from the start\n\nThe project is now **100% ready for installation and execution** with professional-grade setup and documentation.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

The changes modernize the data access layer, update dependency management, and refactor beans and tests for compatibility with the new frameworks.\r\n\r\n**Dependency and Configuration Updates**\r\n* Added missing dependencies for Hibernate 6, Spring 6, and Jakarta Persistence in `pom.xml`, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of these frameworks.\r\n* Replaced Hibernate-specific beans with JPA-based beans in `beans.xml`, switching from `HibernateTransactionManager` and `SessionFactory` to `JpaTransactionManager` and `EntityManagerFactory`, and refactored the `formDao` bean accordingly.\r\n* Updated the form service bean to reference the new `PSFormDao` configuration.\r\n\r\n**Code Refactoring for JPA**\r\n* Refactored `PSFormDao` to remove `HibernateDaoSupport` and use JPA's `EntityManager` for all persistence operations, replacing methods like `getHibernateTemplate().saveOrUpdate` and query execution with JPA equivalents.
