Perfect! 🚀\n\nNow, let's use our MCP server's tools and Copilot to do a bit of triage and get some work done.\n\n### :keyboard: Activity: Easily implement an important issue\n\n1. Ensure the **Copilot Chat** panel is open and **Agent** mode is selected. Verify the MCP server tools are also still available.\n\n1. Ask Copilot about the open issues on this repository.\n\n   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)\n   >\n   > ```prompt\n   > How many open issues are there on my repository?\n   > ```\n\n   > 🪧 **Note:** Check that the List Issues tool is called with proper parameters.\n\n1. Ask Copilot to summarize the important issues.\n\n   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)\n   >\n   > ```prompt\n   > Oh no.

Review the suggested issues. If Copilot didn't give a specific recommendation, try providing some feedback to narrow the results.\n\n1. With the list narrowed, ask Copilot to implement an issue. **Mona won't grade if the changes work, just that an attempt was made.**\n\n   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)\n   >\n   > ```prompt\n   > #codebase Let's do the first one. Follow these steps:\n   > 1. Checkout a new local branch for making our changes.\n   > 2. Make the changes then confirm with me that they look correct.\n   > 3. Push the changes and start a pull request.\n   > ```\n\n   > ⚠️ **Warning:** Always verify the the actions Copilot is asking to perform, especially with the external abilities provided by an MCP server, which probably have no undo option.\n\n1. Once the pull request is created, Mona will start checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch of the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next step!\n\n<details>\n<summary>Having trouble?</summary><br/>\n\n- If tools are not being requested, verify your MCP configuration is correct.\n- If Copilot cannot retrieve results, verify you are using this Codespace's token or a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions. By default, the codespace token we are using only has access to this repository.\n\n</details>\n",

It also includes some minor improvements to scikit-learn compatibility and code clarity. The changes affect both the library code and the example notebooks.\r\n\r\n**1. Codebase Restructuring and Import Updates**\r\n- Moved all decision tree modules (e.g., `estimators.py`, `node.py`, `predict.py`, `split.py`, `train.py`, `visualize.py`, and related objects) from `random_tree_models/decisiontree/` to `random_tree_models/models/decisiontree/` and updated all corresponding import statements throughout the codebase and notebooks.

Utility Functions for Random Sampling**\r\n- Added new utility functions `get_random_sample_ids` and `get_random_feature_ids` in `random_tree_models/models/decisiontree/random.py` to encapsulate logic for randomly selecting samples and features, and refactored their usage in the decision tree estimator code.

While this pattern of using a closure to lazily resolve the dependency works, it can be confusing and makes the dependency graph harder to understand.\n\nA cleaner approach would be to break this cycle using setter injection. This would make the dependency flow unidirectional and easier to follow.\n\nExample of a possible refactoring:\n\n**extension.ts**\n```typescript\n// Create provider without the engine first\nconst provider = new MyPanelProvider(context, statusBarItem, fileManager);\n\n// Create engine, passing provider as the reporter\nconst stressTestEngine = new StressTestEngine(\n    new Compiler(provider),\n    new Executor(),\n    fileManager,\n    provider,\n    baseDir\n);\n\n// Now, inject the engine into the provider\nprovider.setStressTestEngine(stressTestEngine);\n```\n\n**MyPanelProvider.ts**\n```typescript\n// ...\n// Remove stressTestEngine from constructor\nconstructor(\n    private readonly _context: vscode.ExtensionContext,\n    statusBarItem: vscode.StatusBarItem,\n    private readonly _fileManager: IFileManager\n) { /* ... */ }\n\nprivate _stressTestEngine!: IStressTestEngine; // or IStressTestEngine | undefined\n\npublic setStressTestEngine(engine: IStressTestEngine) {\n    this._stressTestEngine = engine;\n}\n// ...\n```\nThis would require some changes in `MyPanelProvider` but would result in a cleaner architecture.",

The decomposition of the `StressTestEngine` into smaller, single-responsibility components is a major improvement for maintainability and testability. The introduction of interfaces for dependency injection is also a great step forward. I have identified a couple of areas for improvement: one regarding duplicated code in the new interfaces file, and another suggesting a cleaner way to handle a circular dependency that was noted as a 'hack' in the code. Overall, these are excellent changes that greatly improve the project's architecture.",
