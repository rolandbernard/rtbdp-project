CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU addles that function\nfor kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.\n\nThe point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access\ntask->fpu after going through kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all\nkernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task->fpu.\n\nSolution\n--------\nOne option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from\nx86_task_fpu(). However, that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a\ndefense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel threads.\n\nInstead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads\naltogether. The data was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is\nonly updated for user threads, not kernel threads.\n\nIf anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come\nback later and do it properly, separate from this bug fix.\n\n[ dhansen: mostly rewrite changelog ]\n\nFixes: 22aafe3bcb67 (\"x86/fpu: Remove init_task FPU state dependencies, add debugging warning for PF_KTHREAD tasks\")\nCo-developed-by: Sohil Mehta <sohil.mehta@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Sohil Mehta <sohil.mehta@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Fushuai Wang <wangfushuai@baidu.com>\nSigned-off-by: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250811185044.2227268-1-sohil.mehta%40intel.com",

                "body" : "This PR consolidates the Rotogrinders projection implementation by renaming `rotogrinders_refactored` to `rotogrinders`, eliminating the need for a fallback library as requested.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- **Renamed file**: `nflprojections/sources/rotogrinders_refactored.py` → `nflprojections/sources/rotogrinders.py`\n- **Updated imports**: Modified import statements in `nflprojections/__init__.py` and `nflprojections/sources/__init__.py` to reference the new module name\n- **Updated documentation**: Fixed reference in `docs/api/sources.md` to point to the correct module path\n- **Cleaned up language**: Removed \"refactored\" terminology from docstrings and comments since this is now the primary implementation\n\n## Impact\n\nThe `RotogrindersProjections` class remains unchanged and maintains full backward compatibility for users importing it through the public API:\n\n```python\nfrom nflprojections import RotogrindersProjections  # Still works\nfrom nflprojections.sources import RotogrindersProjections  # Still works\n```\n\nThe old import path `from nflprojections.sources.rotogrinders_refactored import RotogrindersProjections` is no longer available, which is the intended behavior.\n\nAll existing functionality, including the functional component architecture with separate fetcher, parser, and standardizer components, remains intact.\n\nFixes #56.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
