Link any relevant discussions or issues. -->\r\n\r\nbecause i think it would be a very interesting and unique station in the pool with a very special concept and story.\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n<!-- Summary of code changes for easier review. -->\r\n\r\n## Media\r\n<!-- Attach media if the PR makes ingame changes (clothing, items, features, etc).\r\nSmall fixes/refactors are exempt.

'Other'\n+                            ~~\nUnerwartetes Token \"??\" in Ausdruck oder Anweisung.\n```\n\n**Solution:** Replaced the null-coalescing operator with PowerShell 5.1 compatible conditional syntax:\n```powershell\n# Before (PowerShell 7.0+ only)\nreturn $primaryGPU ?? 'Other'\n\n# After (PowerShell 5.1+ compatible)\nreturn if ($primaryGPU) { $primaryGPU } else { 'Other' }\n```\n\n## 📋 Enhanced README with Modern Design\n\nCompletely redesigned the README.md to be more visually appealing and informative:\n\n### ✨ Visual Improvements\n- **Modern badges** with `for-the-badge` style and platform logos\n- **Centered layout** with better visual hierarchy\n- **Collapsible sections** for features to improve readability\n- **Tables and highlighted boxes** for better information organization\n- **Enhanced typography** with emojis and consistent formatting\n\n### 📚 New Content Sections\n- **Comprehensive Changelog** with detailed version history (v2.1, v2.0, v1.x)\n- **Future Roadmap** with planned features and development status\n- **Community engagement** section with contribution guidelines\n- **Enhanced installation guide** with step-by-step instructions\n- **Acknowledgments and sponsorship** information\n\n### 🎯 Key Additions\n- **PowerShell version badge** showing 5.1+ compatibility\n- **Detailed feature descriptions** with benefits and technical details\n- **Status indicators** for roadmap items (In Progress, Planned, Future)\n- **Community links** for Discord, Reddit, and GitHub discussions\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\n- ✅ Verified no null-coalescing operators remain in codebase\n- ✅ Confirmed PowerShell 5.1 compatible syntax is properly implemented\n- ✅ All existing functionality preserved\n- ✅ README renders correctly with enhanced formatting\n\n## 📊 Impact\n\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Now works on PowerShell 5.1+ (covers 99%+ of Windows installations)\n- **User Experience:** Significantly improved README presentation and information discovery\n- **Community Growth:** Better onboarding and engagement opportunities\n- **Maintenance:** Enhanced documentation for future contributors\n\nThis change ensures broader compatibility while modernizing the project presentation to attract more users and contributors.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

'Other'\n+                            ~~\nUnerwartetes Token \"??\" in Ausdruck oder Anweisung.\n```\n\n**Solution:** Replaced the null-coalescing operator with PowerShell 5.1 compatible conditional syntax:\n```powershell\n# Before (PowerShell 7.0+ only)\nreturn $primaryGPU ?? 'Other'\n\n# After (PowerShell 5.1+ compatible)\nreturn if ($primaryGPU) { $primaryGPU } else { 'Other' }\n```\n\n## 📋 Enhanced README with Modern Design\n\nCompletely redesigned the README.md to be more visually appealing and informative:\n\n### ✨ Visual Improvements\n- **Modern badges** with `for-the-badge` style and platform logos\n- **Centered layout** with better visual hierarchy\n- **Collapsible sections** for features to improve readability\n- **Tables and highlighted boxes** for better information organization\n- **Enhanced typography** with emojis and consistent formatting\n\n### 📚 New Content Sections\n- **Comprehensive Changelog** with detailed version history (v2.1, v2.0, v1.x)\n- **Future Roadmap** with planned features and development status\n- **Community engagement** section with contribution guidelines\n- **Enhanced installation guide** with step-by-step instructions\n- **Acknowledgments and sponsorship** information\n\n### 🎯 Key Additions\n- **PowerShell version badge** showing 5.1+ compatibility\n- **Detailed feature descriptions** with benefits and technical details\n- **Status indicators** for roadmap items (In Progress, Planned, Future)\n- **Community links** for Discord, Reddit, and GitHub discussions\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\n- ✅ Verified no null-coalescing operators remain in codebase\n- ✅ Confirmed PowerShell 5.1 compatible syntax is properly implemented\n- ✅ All existing functionality preserved\n- ✅ README renders correctly with enhanced formatting\n\n## 📊 Impact\n\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Now works on PowerShell 5.1+ (covers 99%+ of Windows installations)\n- **User Experience:** Significantly improved README presentation and information discovery\n- **Community Growth:** Better onboarding and engagement opportunities\n- **Maintenance:** Enhanced documentation for future contributors\n\nThis change ensures broader compatibility while modernizing the project presentation to attract more users and contributors.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

'Other'\n+                            ~~\nUnerwartetes Token \"??\" in Ausdruck oder Anweisung.\n```\n\n**Solution:** Replaced the null-coalescing operator with PowerShell 5.1 compatible conditional syntax:\n```powershell\n# Before (PowerShell 7.0+ only)\nreturn $primaryGPU ?? 'Other'\n\n# After (PowerShell 5.1+ compatible)\nreturn if ($primaryGPU) { $primaryGPU } else { 'Other' }\n```\n\n## 📋 Enhanced README with Modern Design\n\nCompletely redesigned the README.md to be more visually appealing and informative:\n\n### ✨ Visual Improvements\n- **Modern badges** with `for-the-badge` style and platform logos\n- **Centered layout** with better visual hierarchy\n- **Collapsible sections** for features to improve readability\n- **Tables and highlighted boxes** for better information organization\n- **Enhanced typography** with emojis and consistent formatting\n\n### 📚 New Content Sections\n- **Comprehensive Changelog** with detailed version history (v2.1, v2.0, v1.x)\n- **Future Roadmap** with planned features and development status\n- **Community engagement** section with contribution guidelines\n- **Enhanced installation guide** with step-by-step instructions\n- **Acknowledgments and sponsorship** information\n\n### 🎯 Key Additions\n- **PowerShell version badge** showing 5.1+ compatibility\n- **Detailed feature descriptions** with benefits and technical details\n- **Status indicators** for roadmap items (In Progress, Planned, Future)\n- **Community links** for Discord, Reddit, and GitHub discussions\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\n- ✅ Verified no null-coalescing operators remain in codebase\n- ✅ Confirmed PowerShell 5.1 compatible syntax is properly implemented\n- ✅ All existing functionality preserved\n- ✅ README renders correctly with enhanced formatting\n\n## 📊 Impact\n\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Now works on PowerShell 5.1+ (covers 99%+ of Windows installations)\n- **User Experience:** Significantly improved README presentation and information discovery\n- **Community Growth:** Better onboarding and engagement opportunities\n- **Maintenance:** Enhanced documentation for future contributors\n\nThis change ensures broader compatibility while modernizing the project presentation to attract more users and contributors.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

Free domains (e.g. Freenom) and shared domains (e.g. noip.com) are not allowed.\n- [x] I'll keep my instance up to date, at the very least 1 week old. Example program for keeping up to date: watchtower, cron, ouroboros.\n- [x] I give the right to `check.searx.space` to check my instance (every 3 hours for the response times, every 24 hours for the other tests).\n- [x] I acknowledge that managing a public instance is not an easy task and require spending time to keep the instance in good health. E.g. look after your instance by using a monitoring system.\n- [x] I guarantee to keep an uptime per month of my instance at **minimum 90%**. Please ask for a removal of your instance if there is a planned long downtime or notify us [here](https://github.com/searxng/searx-instances/discussions/categories/report-instance-downtime) for a short downtime.\n- [x] I do not track the users of my instance with any analytics or tracking software.\n- [x] I won't try to manipulate the ranking of my instance in a way that give an unfair advantage over the other public instances in the list. (e.g. caching requests for searx.space server)\n- [x] I control the final webserver (software) that is serving the requests to the users of my instance. Here is a non-exhaustive list of forbidden hosting types: Cloudflare, PaaS, managed (hosting provider controlled) HTTP(S) load balancer (e.g. AWS ALB), shared Web hosting. TCP load balancer is fine. Cloudflare DNS only (grey cloud) is fine.\n- [x] If needed, I can restrict users from accessing my instance for the only sole reason of keeping my instance in working conditions for the other users ([detailed description](https://github.com/searxng/searx-instances/pull/346) - evidence need to be provided when asked). Other means of restriction is forbidden.\n\n### Bot protection requirement\n\n- [x] Yes I have configured the `server.public_instance` parameter.\n\n### Source code URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Comment\n\n_No response_",

                    "description" : "## Automated Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n[Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) keeps source code dependencies up-to-date using automated Pull Requests. It will scan repositories for package manager files (e.g. from npm/Yarn, Bundler, Composer, Go Modules, Pip/Pipenv/Poetry, Maven/Gradle, Dockerfile/k8s, and many more), and submit Pull Requests with updated versions whenever they are found.\r\n\r\nThis app is free to install for both public and private repositories. Service is provided complimentary of Mend (formerly known as WhiteSource) and no paid plan is required.\r\n\r\n### Intelligent, helpful onboarding\r\n\r\n![Onboarding](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/onboarding.png)\r\n\r\nInstall Mend Renovate risk-free and you'll first receive an onboarding Pull Request in each repository. It analyzes the repository files and describes what will happen next, so there's no surprises. \r\n\r\n### Unopinionated, highly flexible configuration\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"rangeStrategy\": \"pin\",\r\n  \"ignorePaths\": [\"examples/**\"],\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packagePatterns\": [\"^angular.*\"],\r\n    \"groupName\": \"angular\",\r\n    \"automerge\": true\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModify any of Renovate's smart defaults with custom overrides at the repository, package file, dependency type, and package levels. \r\n\r\n### Support for monorepo directory structures\r\n\r\nRenovate will scan all files in each repository to look for relevant package files. It will also group upgrades from the same monorepo into a single PR to ensure tests pass and PR noise is reduced. Natively supports Lerna and Yarn Workspaces with zero configuration necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is also works fine with a mix of package managers / languages within the same repository.\r\n\r\n### Automatic lock file and checksum support\r\n\r\nRenovate will generate updated lock files such as `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` if you're already using them. It will also automatically resolve any conflicts after merges.\r\n\r\n### Ease the noise with custom schedules\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\",\r\n  \"schedule\": \"before 5am every weekday\",\r\n  \"lockFileMaintenance\": {\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"schedule\": \"after 10pm on sunday\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packageNames\": [\"aws-sdk\"],\r\n    \"schedule\": \"before 5am every wednesday\"\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrottle updates however you want with schedules, configurable right down to the per-package level.\r\n\r\n### Rules-based automerging\r\n\r\n![automerging](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/automerged-pr.png)\r\n\r\nMerge some updates without human intervention if they pass tests and satisfy your automerge rules.",

In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request introduces a new allowValidatorFailure option to the file parsing utilities, enabling graceful handling of validation failures by returning undefined instead of throwing an error. It also enhances TypeScript type inference for various validator configurations, ensuring better type safety and developer experience.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Graceful Validator Failures**: A new allowValidatorFailure option has been added, which, when enabled, causes the file parsing functions to return undefined instead of throwing an error if a provided validator fails.\n* **Enhanced TypeScript Type Inference**: The PR significantly improves type safety by providing specific return types for createLimo* functions based on whether a validator is used and the allowValidatorFailure option is set. This includes T | undefined for graceful failures and T for strict validation.\n* **Core Logic Update**: The internal LimoFile._read() method has been updated to incorporate the new allowValidatorFailure logic, ensuring that validation failures are handled according to the specified option.\n* **Comprehensive Testing**: New tests have been added to cover various scenarios of validator failures, including cases where allowValidatorFailure is true, false, or undefined, across all supported file formats (JSON, JSONC, TOML, YAML, Text).\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

                    "description" : "\r\nSonarQube Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms. Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nFor those requiring US-based hosting, [SonarQube Cloud US](https://sonarqube.us/) offers the perfect alternative. If you need data residency outside the US or within the EU, [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) with this GitHub app is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action? You can [explore current Open Source projects in SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/explore/projects?sort=-analysis_date) that are using the [Clean as You Code](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/our-unique-approach/) methodology.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?
