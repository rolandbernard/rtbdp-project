This results in a visually cluttered layout that affects readability and user experience.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nNavigate to the homepage.\nScroll to the FAQ section.\nObserve the tight spacing between FAQ items and lack of vertical padding.\n\nExpected Behavior: \nEach FAQ item should have:\nSufficient vertical spacing between questions.\nPadding within each item for better readability.\nConsistent margins aligning with the overall page layout.\n\nSuggested Fix:\nAdd padding-block and margin-block to FAQ items.\nConsider using utility classes like py-4, mb-2, or space-y-4 (if using Tailwind).\nEnsure responsive spacing across breakpoints.\n\nScreenshot:\n\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"975\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb2231ec-e131-40c7-a8a5-ce7dbdcf73d8\" />\n\n\nHi\nI'd like to take up this issue and ensure the FAQ section meets accessibility and visual clarity standards.\n\nAs an active contributor in GirlScript Summer of Code 2025, I’ve been consistently working on optimizing UI components, resolving layout inconsistencies, and improving CSS hierarchy across the project. I specialize in responsive design using Tailwind and semantic HTML, and I’ve previously addressed similar spacing and alignment issues in the gallery and footer sections.\n\nI'll refactor the FAQ layout to include proper padding, spacing, and responsive behavior, ensuring it aligns with the overall design system. Assigning this to myself now — looking forward to delivering a clean and accessible fix!\n\nAssignee: @janavipandole ",

It will need to be distributed as a zip/tarball/deb/rpm/installer etc. CPack should make this easy.\r\n  - Uses same config file format as CLI just with a different loader.\r\n- Added a few extra data members to DTOs for better presentation.\r\n- Some classes (Options and Layout are the big ones) gained setters where they previously had none.\r\n- Reworked solver output around callbacks instead of outputting directly.\r\n- Lifted big chunks of README.md into the UI with light editing to suit context.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

                "body" : "This PR adds support for ConnectionDefinition entities in the MeshKit registration system. Previously, when importing models that contained connection definitions, these entities were being silently ignored because the registration pipeline didn't know how to handle them.\r\n\r\n## What was broken\r\n\r\nThe main issue was in `utils/utils.go` - the `FindEntityType` function was missing a case for `connections.meshery.io`, so it couldn't identify connection definition files. This meant connection definitions were being skipped during model import.\r\n\r\n## What I fixed\r\n\r\n- Added the missing `connections.meshery.io` case to `FindEntityType` in `utils/utils.go`\r\n- Made `getEntity` public as `GetEntity` in `models/registration/utils.go` so it can be tested\r\n- Updated `PackagingUnit` in `models/registration/register.go` to include connections and handle their registration\r\n- Added connection file processing in `models/registration/dir.go` \r\n- Added connection support to the database schema in `models/meshmodel/registry/registry.go`\r\n- Created the `ConnectionDefinition` type in `models/meshmodel/core/v1beta1/connection.go`\r\n- Added `ConnectionSchemaVersion` constant in the corev1beta1 package\r\n\r\nBased on reviewer feedback, I've made the following adjustments:\r\n- Reverted `GetEntity` back to unexported `getEntity` since it's not used outside the package\r\n- Moved `ConnectionSchemaVersion` constant to the corev1beta1 package\r\n- Removed unnecessary changes to OPA and OCI files that were unrelated to the ConnectionDefinition task\r\n- Kept only the essential changes needed for ConnectionDefinition support\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this with a sample ConnectionDefinition JSON file. The pipeline now works correctly:\r\n- `FindEntityType` properly identifies connection definition files\r\n- `getEntity` parses them into the right type\r\n- The registration process handles them end-to-end\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, connection definitions were just being ignored. Now the registry can properly handle all entity types: components, relationships, and connections.\r\n\r\nRelated to #762\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notes for Reviewers**\r\n- [Signed commits](CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] Yes, I signed my commits.",

                "body" : "This PR adds support for ConnectionDefinition entities in the MeshKit registration system. Previously, when importing models that contained connection definitions, these entities were being silently ignored because the registration pipeline didn't know how to handle them.\r\n\r\n## What was broken\r\n\r\nThe main issue was in `utils/utils.go` - the `FindEntityType` function was missing a case for `connections.meshery.io`, so it couldn't identify connection definition files. This meant connection definitions were being skipped during model import.\r\n\r\n## What I fixed\r\n\r\n- Added the missing `connections.meshery.io` case to `FindEntityType` in `utils/utils.go`\r\n- Made `getEntity` public as `GetEntity` in `models/registration/utils.go` so it can be tested\r\n- Updated `PackagingUnit` in `models/registration/register.go` to include connections and handle their registration\r\n- Added connection file processing in `models/registration/dir.go` \r\n- Added connection support to the database schema in `models/meshmodel/registry/registry.go`\r\n- Created the `ConnectionDefinition` type in `models/meshmodel/core/v1beta1/connection.go`\r\n- Added `ConnectionSchemaVersion` constant in the corev1beta1 package\r\n\r\nBased on reviewer feedback, I've made the following adjustments:\r\n- Reverted `GetEntity` back to unexported `getEntity` since it's not used outside the package\r\n- Moved `ConnectionSchemaVersion` constant to the corev1beta1 package\r\n- Removed unnecessary changes to OPA and OCI files that were unrelated to the ConnectionDefinition task\r\n- Kept only the essential changes needed for ConnectionDefinition support\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this with a sample ConnectionDefinition JSON file. The pipeline now works correctly:\r\n- `FindEntityType` properly identifies connection definition files\r\n- `getEntity` parses them into the right type\r\n- The registration process handles them end-to-end\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, connection definitions were just being ignored. Now the registry can properly handle all entity types: components, relationships, and connections.\r\n\r\nRelated to #762\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Notes for Reviewers**\r\n- [Signed commits](CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] Yes, I signed my commits.",

When the content contains Unicode characters like Chinese text '中', the slice operation panics.\n\n### Impact\n- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Causes complete application crash\n- **Affected Operations**: \n  - Git repository ingestion fails\n  - Any document insertion with Unicode content fails\n  - Database becomes unusable for international content\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n1. Create a document with Unicode content (Chinese, emoji, etc.)\n2. Try to insert it into KotaDB\n3. Application panics at trigram index insertion\n\n### Discovery Method\nFound during dogfooding validation while ingesting KotaDB's own codebase, which contains Unicode test files (`tests/unicode_handling_test.rs`).\n\n### Suggested Fix\nUse proper UTF-8 aware string slicing:\n```rust\n// Instead of:\nformat!(\"{} ...\", &content_str[..497])\n\n// Use char_indices to find safe boundary:\nlet truncate_at = content_str.char_indices()\n    .take(497)  // Take first 497 chars\n    .last()\n    .map(|(i, _)| i)\n    .unwrap_or(content_str.len());\nformat!(\"{} ...\", &content_str[..truncate_at])\n```\n\n### Related\n- `tests/unicode_handling_test.rs` - Contains Unicode test cases that trigger this bug\n- Issue #106 mentioned in the test file about Unicode handling\n\n### Priority\nThis is a **CRITICAL** bug that completely breaks Unicode support and makes KotaDB unusable for international content.\n\n### Validation Note\nThis issue was discovered through continuous dogfooding validation (Issue #214), demonstrating the value of testing KotaDB on its own codebase.",

Run full repository ingestion with Unicode test files\n2. Test with international content (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc.)\n3. Ensure trigram generation works correctly across character boundaries\n4. Verify content preview truncation respects UTF-8 boundaries throughout the codebase\n\nThis critical bug prevents dogfooding validation and makes KotaDB unusable for any real-world content containing Unicode characters.",

Every schema in that directory contains a `opacity` property. `layers[{layerId}].*` contains fields that are generic to all layers, like `visible`. Those are defined in `packages/schema/src/schema/project/jgis.json`.\n\n### Preferred solution\n\nI think `opacity` is the exact same type of property as `visible` -- it's generic to all layers, and their actual functions are in the same category. I think they should be siblings, `layer[{layerId}].opacity`, `layer[{layerId}].visible`. They would both be defined only once in `packages/schema/src/schema/project/jgis.json`.\n\n### Alternative solutions\n\n_No response_",

Both places this event is called from (TrialSpawners and Vaults) currently have the NMS-equivalent LootTable readily available.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nGetting the trial spawner configurations and filtering based on the Map of weighted LootTables, but this isn't useful when wanting to check the exact loot table that was randomly picked to drop the items. \n\n### Other\n\n_No response_",
