In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request addresses build compatibility issues by replacing an external `@jsr/std__async` dependency with a custom `delay` function. The new implementation is self-contained and maintains support for `AbortSignal` to ensure graceful cancellation of asynchronous operations. Additionally, the PR includes minor code cleanup by removing unused imports and associated logic, contributing to a more streamlined and robust codebase.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **Dependency Replacement**: Replaced the external `@jsr/std__async` dependency with a custom-implemented `delay` function to resolve build compatibility issues.\n* **Custom Delay Implementation**: A new `delay` function was implemented directly within `src/_live-rendering.ts`, ensuring it supports `AbortSignal` for graceful cancellation, mirroring the functionality of the removed dependency.\n* **Code Cleanup/Refactoring**: Removed an unused import and related logic for `getClaudePaths` in `src/commands/statusline.ts`, streamlining the codebase.\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point in your pull request via creating an issue comment (i.e. comment on the pull request page) using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
