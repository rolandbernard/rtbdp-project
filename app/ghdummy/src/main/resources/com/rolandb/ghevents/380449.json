New setting options in th playground make it possible to enable Shiki highlighting.\r\n\r\n[lexical-code-shiki] implements dynamic support for all languages and themes supported by Shiki.\r\n\r\nPrism support can be considered backward compatible except for one minor aspect enabling CodeBlocks to have dynamic loading of languages (see Breaking Changes below). This affects a small number of tests in [lexical-code] and [lexical-markdown].\r\n\r\nThe support is considered experimental in the sense that more work is expected on it before shiki support should be considered backwards compatible. Some things are still subject to change such as:\r\n - Build time preloading of syntax and theme modules\r\n - Restructuring shiki highlighted code blocks to be line-oriented (and having a gutter implementation for it)\r\n - Extracting prism to its own optional package (breaking change)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nCodeNow now applies the `data-highlight-language` DOM attribute after highlighting, rather than immediately. The `data-language` attribute behavior is unchanged. This post-highlighting setting also applies to `getIsSyntaxHighlightSupported()` and its underlying `__isSyntaxHighlightSupported` property. Previously this would have been set eagerly because all known Prism languages were known and loaded at build time, now it represents whether the syntax highlighting has occurred or not.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nAll tests related to Prism have been left unmodified except those mentioned related to the Breaking changes.\r\nTests have been added to Shiki to control that all the Tab/Indent/Outdent cases pass.\r\nManual tests have been applied, but other Shiki tests that imply the tokenization of the code have been postponed until the restructuring of shiki highlighted code blocks to be line-oriented, as all the expected html snippets will need updating. These Shiki tests will be written by taking all the Prism tests as a starting point.\r\nThe Prism tests themselves will be kept as-is.",

Updated types: `Route.MetaArgs`, `Route.MetaMatch`, `MetaArgs`, `MetaMatch`, `Route.ComponentProps.matches`, `UIMatch`\n  - `@deprecated` warnings have been added to the existing `data` properties to point users to new `loaderData` properties, in preparation for removing the `data` properties in a future major release\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Prevent *\"Did not find corresponding fetcher result\"* console error when navigating during a `fetcher.submit` revalidation ([#&#8203;14114](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14114))\n\n- Bubble client-side middleware errors prior to `next` to the appropriate ancestor error boundary ([#&#8203;14138](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14138))\n\n- Switch Lazy Route Discovery manifest URL generation to usea standalone `URLSearchParams` instance instead of `URL.searchParams` to avoid a major performance bottleneck in Chrome ([#&#8203;14084](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14084))\n\n- Adjust internal RSC usage of `React.use` to avoid Webpack compilation errors when using React 18 ([#&#8203;14113](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14113))\n\n- Remove dependency on `@types/node` in TypeScript declaration files ([#&#8203;14059](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14059))\n\n- Fix types for `UIMatch` to reflect that the `loaderData`/`data` properties may be `undefined` ([#&#8203;12206](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12206))\n\n  - When an `ErrorBoundary` is being rendered, not all active matches will have loader data available, since it may have been their `loader` that threw to trigger the boundary\n  - The `UIMatch.data` type was not correctly handing this and would always reflect the presence of data, leading to the unexpected runtime errors when an `ErrorBoundary` was rendered\n  - ⚠️ This may cause some type errors to show up in your code for unguarded `match.data` accesses - you should properly guard for `undefined` values in those scenarios.\n\n  ```tsx\n  // app/root.tsx\n  export function loader() {\n    someFunctionThatThrows(); // ❌ Throws an Error\n    return { title: \"My Title\" };\n  }\n\n  export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n    let matches = useMatches();\n    let rootMatch = matches[0] as UIMatch<Awaited<ReturnType<typeof loader>>>;\n    //  ^ rootMatch.data is incorrectly typed here, so TypeScript does not\n    //    complain if you do the following which throws an error at runtime:\n    let { title } = rootMatch.data; // 💥\n\n    return <html>...</html>;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Ensure resource route errors go through `handleError` w/middleware enabled ([#&#8203;14078](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14078))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Propagate returned Response from server middleware if next wasn't called ([#&#8203;14093](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14093))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Allow server middlewares to return `data()` values which will be converted into a `Response` ([#&#8203;14093](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14093))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Update middleware error handling so that the `next` function never throws and instead handles any middleware errors at the proper `ErrorBoundary` and returns the `Response` up through the ancestor `next` function ([#&#8203;14118](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14118))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] When middleware is enabled, make the `context` parameter read-only (via `Readonly<unstable_RouterContextProvider>`) so that TypeScript will not allow you to write arbitrary fields to it in loaders, actions, or middleware. ([#&#8203;14097](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14097))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Rename and alter the signature/functionality of the `unstable_respond` API in `staticHandler.query`/`staticHandler.queryRoute` ([#&#8203;14103](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14103))\n\n  - The API has been renamed to `unstable_generateMiddlewareResponse` for clarity\n  - The main functional change is that instead of running the loaders/actions before calling `unstable_respond` and handing you the result, we now pass a `query`/`queryRoute` function as a parameter and you execute the loaders/actions inside your callback, giving you full access to pre-processing and error handling\n  - The `query` version of the API now has a signature of `(query: (r: Request) => Promise<StaticHandlerContext | Response>) => Promise<Response>`\n  - The `queryRoute` version of the API now has a signature of `(queryRoute: (r: Request) => Promise<Response>) => Promise<Response>`\n  - This allows for more advanced usages such as running logic before/after calling `query` and direct error handling of errors thrown from query\n  - ⚠️ This is a breaking change if you've adopted the `staticHandler` `unstable_respond` API\n\n  ```tsx\n  let response = await staticHandler.query(request, {\n    requestContext: new unstable_RouterContextProvider(),\n    async unstable_generateMiddlewareResponse(query) {\n      try {\n        // At this point we've run middleware top-down so we need to call the\n        // handlers and generate the Response to bubble back up the middleware\n        let result = await query(request);\n        if (isResponse(result)) {\n          return result; // Redirects, etc.\n        }\n        return await generateHtmlResponse(result);\n      } catch (error: unknown) {\n        return generateErrorResponse(error);\n      }\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Convert internal middleware implementations to use the new `unstable_generateMiddlewareResponse` API ([#&#8203;14103](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14103))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Change `getLoadContext` signature (`type GetLoadContextFunction`) when `future.unstable_middleware` is enabled so that it returns an `unstable_RouterContextProvider` instance instead of a `Map` used to contruct the instance internally ([#&#8203;14097](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14097))\n  - This also removes the `type unstable_InitialContext` export\n  - ⚠️ This is a breaking change if you have adopted middleware and are using a custom server with a `getLoadContext` function\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Run client middleware on client navigations even if no loaders exist ([#&#8203;14106](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14106))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Change the `unstable_getContext` signature on `RouterProvider`/`HydratedRouter`/`unstable_RSCHydratedRouter` so that it returns an `unstable_RouterContextProvider` instance instead of a `Map` used to contruct the instance internally ([#&#8203;14097](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14097))\n  - ⚠️ This is a breaking change if you have adopted the `unstable_getContext` prop\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] proxy server action side-effect redirects from actions for document and callServer requests ([#&#8203;14131](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14131))\n\n- \\[UNSTABLE] Fix RSC Data Mode issue where routes that return `false` from `shouldRevalidate` would be replaced by an `<Outlet />` ([#&#8203;14071](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14071))\n\n### [`v7.7.1`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#771)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.7.0...react-router@7.7.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- In RSC Data Mode, fix bug where routes with errors weren't forced to revalidate when `shouldRevalidate` returned false ([#&#8203;14026](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14026))\n- In RSC Data Mode, fix `Matched leaf route at location \"/...\" does not have an element or Component` warnings when error boundaries are rendered. ([#&#8203;14021](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/14021))\n\n### [`v7.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#770)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.6.3...react-router@7.7.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Add unstable RSC support ([#&#8203;13700](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13700))\n\n  For more information, see the [RSC documentation](https://reactrouter.com/start/rsc/installation).\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Handle `InvalidCharacterError` when validating cookie signature ([#&#8203;13847](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13847))\n\n- Pass a copy of `searchParams` to the `setSearchParams` callback function to avoid muations of the internal `searchParams` instance. This was an issue when navigations were blocked because the internal instance be out of sync with `useLocation().search`. ([#&#8203;12784](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12784))\n\n- Support invalid `Date` in `turbo-stream` v2 fork ([#&#8203;13684](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13684))\n\n- In Framework Mode, clear critical CSS in development after initial render ([#&#8203;13872](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13872))\n\n- Strip search parameters from `patchRoutesOnNavigation` `path` param for fetcher calls ([#&#8203;13911](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13911))\n\n- Skip scroll restoration on useRevalidator() calls because they're not new locations ([#&#8203;13671](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13671))\n\n- Support unencoded UTF-8 routes in prerender config with `ssr` set to `false` ([#&#8203;13699](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13699))\n\n- Do not throw if the url hash is not a valid URI component ([#&#8203;13247](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13247))\n\n- Fix a regression in `createRoutesStub` introduced with the middleware feature. ([#&#8203;13946](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13946))\n\n  As part of that work we altered the signature to align with the new middleware APIs without making it backwards compatible with the prior `AppLoadContext` API. This permitted `createRoutesStub` to work if you were opting into middleware and the updated `context` typings, but broke `createRoutesStub` for users not yet opting into middleware.\n\n  We've reverted this change and re-implemented it in such a way that both sets of users can leverage it.\n\n  ```tsx\n  // If you have not opted into middleware, the old API should work again\n  let context: AppLoadContext = {\n    /*...*/\n  };\n  let Stub = createRoutesStub(routes, context);\n\n  // If you have opted into middleware, you should now pass an instantiated `unstable_routerContextProvider` instead of a `getContext` factory function.\n  let context = new unstable_RouterContextProvider();\n  context.set(SomeContext, someValue);\n  let Stub = createRoutesStub(routes, context);\n  ```\n\n  ⚠️ This may be a breaking bug for if you have adopted the unstable Middleware feature and are using `createRoutesStub` with the updated API.\n\n- Remove `Content-Length` header from Single Fetch responses ([#&#8203;13902](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13902))\n\n###

Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.6.2...react-router@7.6.3)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Do not serialize types for `useRouteLoaderData<typeof clientLoader>` ([#&#8203;13752](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13752))\n\n  For types to distinguish a `clientLoader` from a `serverLoader`, you MUST annotate `clientLoader` args:\n\n  ```ts\n  //                                   👇 annotation required to skip serializing types\n  export function clientLoader({}: Route.ClientLoaderArgs) {\n    return { fn: () => \"earth\" };\n  }\n\n  function SomeComponent() {\n    const data = useRouteLoaderData<typeof clientLoader>(\"routes/this-route\");\n    const planet = data?.fn() ?? \"world\";\n    return <h1>Hello, {planet}!</h1>;\n  }\n  ```\n\n### [`v7.6.2`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#762)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.6.1...react-router@7.6.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Avoid additional `with-props` chunk in Framework Mode by moving route module component prop logic from the Vite plugin to `react-router` ([#&#8203;13650](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13650))\n- Slight refactor of internal `headers()` function processing for use with RSC ([#&#8203;13639](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13639))\n\n### [`v7.6.1`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#761)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.6.0...react-router@7.6.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Update `Route.MetaArgs` to reflect that `data` can be potentially `undefined` ([#&#8203;13563](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13563))\n\n  This is primarily for cases where a route `loader` threw an error to it's own `ErrorBoundary`. but it also arises in the case of a 404 which renders the root `ErrorBoundary`/`meta` but the root loader did not run because not routes matched.\n\n- Partially revert optimization added in `7.1.4` to reduce calls to `matchRoutes` because it surfaced other issues ([#&#8203;13562](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13562))\n\n- Fix typegen when same route is used at multiple paths ([#&#8203;13574](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13574))\n\n  For example, `routes/route.tsx` is used at 4 different paths here:\n\n  ```ts\n  import { type RouteConfig, route } from \"@&#8203;react-router/dev/routes\";\n  export default [\n    route(\"base/:base\", \"routes/base.tsx\", [\n      route(\"home/:home\", \"routes/route.tsx\", { id: \"home\" }),\n      route(\"changelog/:changelog\", \"routes/route.tsx\", { id: \"changelog\" }),\n      route(\"splat/*\", \"routes/route.tsx\", { id: \"splat\" }),\n    ]),\n    route(\"other/:other\", \"routes/route.tsx\", { id: \"other\" }),\n  ] satisfies RouteConfig;\n  ```\n\n  Previously, typegen would arbitrarily pick one of these paths to be the \"winner\" and generate types for the route module based on that path.\n  Now, typegen creates unions as necessary for alternate paths for the same route file.\n\n- Better types for `params` ([#&#8203;13543](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13543))\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```ts\n  // routes.ts\n  import { type RouteConfig, route } from \"@&#8203;react-router/dev/routes\";\n\n  export default [\n    route(\"parent/:p\", \"routes/parent.tsx\", [\n      route(\"layout/:l\", \"routes/layout.tsx\", [\n        route(\"child1/:c1a/:c1b\", \"routes/child1.tsx\"),\n        route(\"child2/:c2a/:c2b\", \"routes/child2.tsx\"),\n      ]),\n    ]),\n  ] satisfies RouteConfig;\n  ```\n\n  Previously, `params` for the `routes/layout.tsx` route were calculated as `{ p: string, l: string }`.\n  This incorrectly ignores params that could come from child routes.\n  If visiting `/parent/1/layout/2/child1/3/4`, the actual params passed to `routes/layout.tsx` will have a type of `{ p: string, l: string, c1a: string, c1b: string }`.\n\n  Now, `params` are aware of child routes and autocompletion will include child params as optionals:\n\n  ```ts\n  params.|\n  //     ^ cursor is here and you ask for autocompletion\n  // p: string\n  // l: string\n  // c1a?: string\n  // c1b?: string\n  // c2a?: string\n  // c2b?: string\n  ```\n\n  You can also narrow the types for `params` as it is implemented as a normalized union of params for each page that includes `routes/layout.tsx`:\n\n  ```ts\n  if (typeof params.c1a === 'string') {\n    params.|\n    //     ^ cursor is here and you ask for autocompletion\n    // p: string\n    // l: string\n    // c1a: string\n    // c1b: string\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ***\n\n  UNSTABLE: renamed internal `react-router/route-module` export to `react-router/internal`\n  UNSTABLE: removed `Info` export from generated `+types/*` files\n\n- Avoid initial fetcher execution 404 error when Lazy Route Discovery is interrupted by a navigation ([#&#8203;13564](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13564))\n\n- href replaces splats `*` ([#&#8203;13593](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13593))\n\n  ```ts\n  const a = href(\"/products/*\", { \"*\": \"/1/edit\" });\n  // -> /products/1/edit\n  ```\n\n### [`v7.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#760)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.5.3...react-router@7.6.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Added a new `react-router.config.ts` `routeDiscovery` option to configure Lazy Route Discovery behavior. ([#&#8203;13451](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13451))\n  - By default, Lazy Route Discovery is enabled and makes manifest requests to the `/__manifest` path:\n    - `routeDiscovery: { mode: \"lazy\", manifestPath: \"/__manifest\" }`\n  - You can modify the manifest path used:\n    - `routeDiscovery: { mode: \"lazy\", manifestPath: \"/custom-manifest\" }`\n  - Or you can disable this feature entirely and include all routes in the manifest on initial document load:\n    - `routeDiscovery: { mode: \"initial\" }`\n\n- Add support for route component props in `createRoutesStub`. This allows you to unit test your route components using the props instead of the hooks: ([#&#8203;13528](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13528))\n\n  ```tsx\n  let RoutesStub = createRoutesStub([\n    {\n      path: \"/\",\n      Component({ loaderData }) {\n        let data = loaderData as { message: string };\n        return <pre data-testid=\"data\">Message: {data.message}</pre>;\n      },\n      loader() {\n        return { message: \"hello\" };\n      },\n    },\n  ]);\n\n  render(<RoutesStub />);\n\n  await waitFor(() => screen.findByText(\"Message: hello\"));\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `react-router` module augmentation for `NodeNext` ([#&#8203;13498](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13498))\n\n- Don't bundle `react-router` in `react-router/dom` CJS export ([#&#8203;13497](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13497))\n\n- Fix bug where a submitting `fetcher` would get stuck in a `loading` state if a revalidating `loader` redirected ([#&#8203;12873](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12873))\n\n- Fix hydration error if a server `loader` returned `undefined` ([#&#8203;13496](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13496))\n\n- Fix initial load 404 scenarios in data mode ([#&#8203;13500](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13500))\n\n- Stabilize `useRevalidator`'s `revalidate` function ([#&#8203;13542](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13542))\n\n- Preserve status code if a `clientAction` throws a `data()` result in framework mode ([#&#8203;13522](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13522))\n\n- Be defensive against leading double slashes in paths to avoid `Invalid URL` errors from the URL constructor ([#&#8203;13510](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13510))\n  - Note we do not sanitize/normalize these paths - we only detect them so we can avoid the error that would be thrown by `new URL(\"//\", window.location.origin)`\n\n- Remove `Navigator` declaration for `navigator.connection.saveData` to avoid messing with any other types beyond `saveData` in userland ([#&#8203;13512](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13512))\n\n- Fix `handleError` `params` values on `.data` requests for routes with a dynamic param as the last URL segment ([#&#8203;13481](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13481))\n\n- Don't trigger an `ErrorBoundary` UI before the reload when we detect a manifest verison mismatch in Lazy Route Discovery ([#&#8203;13480](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13480))\n\n- Inline `turbo-stream@2.4.1` dependency and fix decoding ordering of Map/Set instances ([#&#8203;13518](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13518))\n\n- Only render dev warnings in DEV mode ([#&#8203;13461](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13461))\n\n- UNSTABLE: Fix a few bugs with error bubbling in middleware use-cases ([#&#8203;13538](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13538))\n\n- Short circuit post-processing on aborted `dataStrategy` requests ([#&#8203;13521](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13521))\n  - This resolves non-user-facing console errors of the form `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'result')`\n\n### [`v7.5.3`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#753)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.5.2...react-router@7.5.3)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix bug where bubbled action errors would result in `loaderData` being cleared at the handling `ErrorBoundary` route ([#&#8203;13476](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13476))\n- Handle redirects from `clientLoader.hydrate` initial load executions ([#&#8203;13477](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13477))\n\n### [`v7.5.2`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#752)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.5.1...react-router@7.5.2)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Update Single Fetch to also handle the 204 redirects used in `?_data` requests in Remix v2 ([#&#8203;13364](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13364))\n  - This allows applications to return a redirect on `.data` requests from outside the scope of React Router (i.e., an `express`/`hono` middleware)\n  - ⚠️ Please note that doing so relies on implementation details that are subject to change without a SemVer major release\n  - This is primarily done to ease upgrading to Single Fetch for existing Remix v2 applications, but the recommended way to handle this is redirecting from a route middleware\n\n- Adjust approach for Prerendering/SPA Mode via headers ([#&#8203;13453](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13453))\n\n### [`v7.5.1`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#751)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.5.0...react-router@7.5.1)\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix single fetch bug where no revalidation request would be made when navigating upwards to a reused parent route ([#&#8203;13253](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13253))\n\n- When using the object-based `route.lazy` API, the `HydrateFallback` and `hydrateFallbackElement` properties are now skipped when lazy loading routes after hydration. ([#&#8203;13376](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13376))\n\n  If you move the code for these properties into a separate file, you can use this optimization to avoid downloading unused hydration code. For example:\n\n  ```ts\n  createBrowserRouter([\n    {\n      path: \"/show/:showId\",\n      lazy: {\n        loader: async () => (await import(\"./show.loader.js\")).loader,\n        Component: async () => (await import(\"./show.component.js\")).Component,\n        HydrateFallback: async () =>\n          (await import(\"./show.hydrate-fallback.js\")).HydrateFallback,\n      },\n    },\n  ]);\n  ```\n\n- Properly revalidate prerendered paths when param values change ([#&#8203;13380](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13380))\n\n- UNSTABLE: Add a new `unstable_runClientMiddleware` argument to `dataStrategy` to enable middleware execution in custom `dataStrategy` implementations ([#&#8203;13395](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13395))\n\n- UNSTABLE: Add better error messaging when `getLoadContext` is not updated to return a `Map`\" ([#&#8203;13242](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13242))\n\n- Do not automatically add `null` to `staticHandler.query()` `context.loaderData` if routes do not have loaders ([#&#8203;13223](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13223))\n  - This was a Remix v2 implementation detail inadvertently left in for React Router v7\n  - Now that we allow returning `undefined` from loaders, our prior check of `loaderData[routeId] !== undefined` was no longer sufficient and was changed to a `routeId in loaderData` check - these `null` values can cause issues for this new check\n  - ⚠️ This could be a \"breaking bug fix\" for you if you are doing manual SSR with `createStaticHandler()`/`<StaticRouterProvider>`, and using `context.loaderData` to control `<RouterProvider>` hydration behavior on the client\n\n- Fix prerendering when a loader returns a redirect ([#&#8203;13365](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13365))\n\n- UNSTABLE: Update context type for `LoaderFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunctionArgs` when middleware is enabled ([#&#8203;13381](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13381))\n\n- Add support for the new `unstable_shouldCallHandler`/`unstable_shouldRevalidateArgs` APIs in `dataStrategy` ([#&#8203;13253](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13253))\n\n### [`v7.5.0`](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/HEAD/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#750)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.4.1...react-router@7.5.0)\n\n##### Minor Changes\n\n- Add granular object-based API for `route.lazy` to support lazy loading of individual route properties, for example: ([#&#8203;13294](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13294))\n\n  ```ts\n  createBrowserRouter([\n    {\n      path: \"/show/:showId\",\n      lazy: {\n        loader: async () => (await import(\"./show.loader.js\")).loader,\n        action: async () => (await import(\"./show.action.js\")).action,\n        Component: async () => (await import(\"./show.component.js\")).Component,\n      },\n    },\n  ]);\n  ```\n\n  **Breaking change for `route.unstable_lazyMiddleware` consumers**\n\n  The `route.unstable_lazyMiddleware` property is no longer supported. If you want to lazily load middleware, you must use the new object-based `route.lazy` API with `route.lazy.unstable_middleware`, for example:\n\n  ```ts\n  createBrowserRouter([\n    {\n      path: \"/show/:showId\",\n      lazy: {\n        unstable_middleware: async () =>\n          (await import(\"./show.middleware.js\")).middleware,\n        // etc.\n      },\n    },\n  ]);\n  ```\n\n##### Patch Changes\n\n- Introduce `unstable_subResourceIntegrity` future flag that enables generation of an importmap with integrity for the scripts that will be loaded by the browser.

To enable, you must enable the flag and the types in your `react-router-config.ts` file:\n\n  ```ts\n  import type { Config } from \"@&#8203;react-router/dev/config\";\n  import type { Future } from \"react-router\";\n\n  declare module \"react-router\" {\n    interface Future {\n      unstable_middleware: true; // 👈 Enable middleware types\n    }\n  }\n\n  export default {\n    future: {\n      unstable_middleware: true, // 👈 Enable middleware\n    },\n  } satisfies Config;\n  ```\n\n  ⚠️ Middleware is unstable and should not be adopted in production. There is at least one known de-optimization in route module loading for `clientMiddleware` that we will be addressing this before a stable release.\n\n  ⚠️ Enabling middleware contains a breaking change to the `context` parameter passed to your `loader`/`action` functions - see below for more information.\n\n  Once enabled, routes can define an array of middleware functions that will run sequentially before route handlers run. These functions accept the same parameters as `loader`/`action` plus an additional `next` parameter to run the remaining data pipeline. This allows middlewares to perform logic before and after handlers execute.\n\n  ```tsx\n  // Framework mode\n  export const unstable_middleware = [serverLogger, serverAuth]; // server\n  export const unstable_clientMiddleware = [clientLogger]; // client\n\n  // Library mode\n  const routes = [\n    {\n      path: \"/\",\n      // Middlewares are client-side for library mode SPA's\n      unstable_middleware: [clientLogger, clientAuth],\n      loader: rootLoader,\n      Component: Root,\n    },\n  ];\n  ```\n\n  Here's a simple example of a client-side logging middleware that can be placed on the root route:\n\n  ```tsx\n  const clientLogger: Route.unstable_ClientMiddlewareFunction = async (\n    { request },\n    next,\n  ) => {\n    let start = performance.now();\n\n    // Run the remaining middlewares and all route loaders\n    await next();\n\n    let duration = performance.now() - start;\n    console.log(`Navigated to ${request.url} (${duration}ms)`);\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Note that in the above example, the `next`/`middleware` functions don't return anything. This is by design as on the client there is no \"response\" to send over the network like there would be for middlewares running on the server. The data is all handled behind the scenes by the stateful `router`.\n\n  For a server-side middleware, the `next` function will return the HTTP `Response` that React Router will be sending across the wire, thus giving you a chance to make changes as needed. You may throw a new response to short circuit and respond immediately, or you may return a new or altered response to override the default returned by `next()`.\n\n  ```tsx\n  const serverLogger: Route.unstable_MiddlewareFunction = async (\n    { request, params, context },\n    next,\n  ) => {\n    let start = performance.now();\n\n    // 👇 Grab the response here\n    let res = await next();\n\n    let duration = performance.now() - start;\n    console.log(`Navigated to ${request.url} (${duration}ms)`);\n\n    // 👇 And return it here (optional if you don't modify the response)\n    return res;\n  };\n  ```\n\n  You can throw a `redirect` from a middleware to short circuit any remaining processing:\n\n  ```tsx\n  import { sessionContext } from \"../context\";\n  const serverAuth: Route.unstable_MiddlewareFunction = (\n    { request, params, context },\n    next,\n  ) => {\n    let session = context.get(sessionContext);\n    let user = session.get(\"user\");\n    if (!user) {\n      session.set(\"returnTo\", request.url);\n      throw redirect(\"/login\", 302);\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n\n  *Note that in cases like this where you don't need to do any post-processing you don't need to call the `next` function or return a `Response`.*\n\n  Here's another example of using a server middleware to detect 404s and check the CMS for a redirect:\n\n  ```tsx\n  const redirects: Route.unstable_MiddlewareFunction = async ({\n    request,\n    next,\n  }) => {\n    // attempt to handle the request\n    let res = await next();\n\n    // if it's a 404, check the CMS for a redirect, do it last\n    // because it's expensive\n    if (res.status === 404) {\n      let cmsRedirect = await checkCMSRedirects(request.url);\n      if (cmsRedirect) {\n        throw redirect(cmsRedirect, 302);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return res;\n  };\n  ```\n\n  **`context` parameter**\n\n  When middleware is enabled, your application will use a different type of `context` parameter in your loaders and actions to provide better type safety. Instead of `AppLoadContext`, `context` will now be an instance of `ContextProvider` that you can use with type-safe contexts (similar to `React.createContext`):\n\n  ```ts\n  import { unstable_createContext } from \"react-router\";\n  import { Route } from \"./+types/root\";\n  import type { Session } from \"./sessions.server\";\n  import { getSession } from \"./sessions.server\";\n\n  let sessionContext = unstable_createContext<Session>();\n\n  const sessionMiddleware: Route.unstable_MiddlewareFunction = ({\n    context,\n    request,\n  }) => {\n    let session = await getSession(request);\n    context.set(sessionContext, session);\n    //                          ^ must be of type Session\n  };\n\n  // ... then in some downstream middleware\n  const loggerMiddleware: Route.unstable_MiddlewareFunction = ({\n    context,\n    request,\n  }) => {\n    let session = context.get(sessionContext);\n    //  ^ typeof Session\n    console.log(session.get(\"userId\"), request.method, request.url);\n  };\n\n  // ... or some downstream loader\n  export function loader({ context }: Route.LoaderArgs) {\n    let session = context.get(sessionContext);\n    let profile = await getProfile(session.get(\"userId\"));\n    return { profile };\n  }\n  ```\n\n  If you are using a custom server with a `getLoadContext` function, the return value for initial context values passed from the server adapter layer is no longer an object and should now return an `unstable_InitialContext` (`Map<RouterContext, unknown>`):\n\n  ```ts\n  let adapterContext = unstable_createContext<MyAdapterContext>();\n\n  function getLoadContext(req, res): unstable_InitialContext {\n    let map = new Map();\n    map.set(adapterContext, getAdapterContext(req));\n    return map;\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Fix types for loaderData and actionData that contained `Record`s ([#&#8203;13139](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/13139))\n\n  UNSTABLE(BREAKING):\n\n  `unstable_SerializesTo` added a way to register custom serialization types in Single Fetch for other library and framework authors like Apollo.\n  It was implemented with branded type whose branded property that was made optional so that casting arbitrary values was easy:\n\n  ```ts\n  // without the brand being marked as optional\n  let x1 = 42 as unknown as unstable_SerializesTo<number>;\n  //          ^^^^^^^^^^\n\n  // with the brand being marked as optional\n  let x2 = 42 as unstable_SerializesTo<number>;\n  ```\n\n  However, this broke type inference in `loaderData` and `actionData` for any `Record` types as those would now (incorrectly) match `unstable_SerializesTo`.\n  This affected all users, not just those that depended on `unstable_SerializesTo`.\n  To fix this, the branded property of `unstable_SerializesTo` is marked as required instead of optional.\n\n  For library and framework authors using `unstable_SerializesTo`, you may need to add `as unknown` casts before casting to `unstable_SerializesTo`.\n\n- Fix single fetch `_root.data` requests when a `basename` is used ([#&#8203;12898](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12898))\n\n- Add `context` support to client side data routers (unstable) ([#&#8203;12941](https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12941))\n\n  Your application `loader` and `action` functions on the client will now receive a `context` parameter. This is an instance of `unstable_RouterContextProvider` that you use with type-safe contexts (similar to `React.createContext`) and is most useful with the corresponding `middleware`/`clientMiddleware` API's:\n\n  ```ts\n  import { unstable_createContext } from \"react-router\";\n\n  type User = {\n    /*...*/\n  };\n\n  let userContext = unstable_createContext<User>();\n\n  function sessionMiddleware({ context }) {\n    let user = await getUser();\n    context.set(userContext, user);\n  }\n\n  // ... then in some downstream loader\n  function loader({ context }) {\n    let user = context.get(userContext);\n    let profile = await getProfile(user.id);\n    return { profile };\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Similar to server-side requests, a fresh `context` will be created per navigation (or `fetcher` call). If you have initial data you'd like to populate in the context for every request, you can provide an `unstable_getContext` function at the root of your app:\n\n  - Library mode - `createBrowserRouter(routes, { unstable_getContext })`\n  - Framework mode - `<HydratedRouter unstable_getContext>`\n\n  This function should return an value of type `unstable_InitialContext` which is a `Map<unstable_RouterContext, unknown>` of context's and initial values:\n\n  ```ts\n  const loggerContext = unstable_createContext<(...args: unknown[]) => void>();\n\n  function logger(...args: unknown[]) {\n    console.log(new Date.toISOString(), ...args);\n  }\n\n  function unstable_getContext() {\n    let map = new Map();\n    map.set(loggerContext, logger);\n    return map;\n  }\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This inconsistency will likely cause dependency conflicts and runtime errors.\n\nPlease update the version in `app/server/appsmith-interfaces/pom.xml` to `0.12.6` as well.\n\nFor better maintainability, I recommend defining the `jjwt.version` property in the parent `app/server/pom.xml` and removing it from this file and `app/server/appsmith-interfaces/pom.xml`.

However, the upgrade is incomplete as it only updates the version in one of the modules. The same dependency version is defined in another module (`app/server/appsmith-interfaces/pom.xml`) and remains at the old version. This will cause dependency conflicts. I've added a critical comment explaining the issue and how to resolve it by ensuring version consistency, preferably by managing the version in the parent POM.",
